<div class="para">Our proof will go like this: factor <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> into three parts, <span class="process-math">\(p_1, p_2, \and b\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \and p_2\)</span> are prime and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is whatever is left with the factorization, such as <span class="process-math">\(10 = 2\cdot5\cdot1\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(b=1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(60=2\cdot5\cdot6\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(b=6\text{,}\)</span> but assuming those prime factors are bigger than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\text{,}\)</span> and look for the contradiction.</div> <article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>

<div class="para">Assume, to the contrary, that every prime divisor of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is greater than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is composite, it has at least two prime factors, <span class="process-math">\(p_1, p_2\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(n = p_1 p_2 b\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is some  positive integer. But since <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \and p_2\)</span> are a prime divisors of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> by our assumption, <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \gt \sqrt{n} \and p_2 \gt \sqrt{n}\text{.}\)</span> So:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
n = p_1  p_2  b \gt \sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot b = nb

This means our original assumption, that every prime factor of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> was greater than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> was wrong, and therefore we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has a prime factor less than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\text{.}\)</span>
