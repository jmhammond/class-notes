<p>Start by observing that a 5-board is just a 4-board with one extra space. How many ways are there to tile this? There are 5 ways to tile a 4-board and all we're doing is adding an extra square. That means this configuration is the same as the number of ways to tile a 4-board, which we found above to be 5, multiplied by the 1 way to add a square: <span class="process-math">\(5\cdot 1 = 5\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>But a 5-board is also a 3-board with an extra two spaces at the end. How many ways can we tile this? This is the same as the number of ways to tile a 3-board because we just add a domino at the end.  If we added a square, it would no longer be a 3-board, it'd become a 4-board we counted above.  Therefore we take the number of ways to tile a 3-board, multiplied by the 1 way to add a domino: <span class="process-math">\(3 \cdot 1 = 3\)</span></p>
<p>These two subdivisions are mutually exclusive (if we added a square to the 3-board, that's turned it into the 4-board, which was already counted above). So we can conclude the number of ways to tile a 5-board is 5+3 = 8.</p>
