Second, if <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is odd, then let <span class="process-math">\(n = y-1\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is odd, <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even, so <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y\)</span> as needed. Therefore <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is surjective.</div></article>
