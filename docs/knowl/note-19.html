</h4>
<p>'Regular'/'weak' induction follows the pattern:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Basis step.</p></li>
<li><p>Inductive hypothesis is <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true</p></li>
<li><p>We show that <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> implies that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">That is, we use this induction process for claims where it's convenient to show that the pattern follows sequentially in a convenient way. Straight-forward examples are the addition formulas;</p>
<p>'Strong' induction follows the pattern:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Basis step(s).   [may need more than one basis, just like some recurrence relations]</p></li>
<li><p>Inductive hypothesis is that <em class="emphasis">all</em> of <span class="process-math">\(P(1), P(2), P(3), \dots P(k)\)</span> are true.   [this is the 'strong' part; it's a larger assumption]</p></li>
<li><p>We show that the hypothesis implies the next element in the sequence, <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\text{,}\)</span> is true  [like before]</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">the difference between this and the previous induction process is that it's sometimes <em class="emphasis">not convenient</em> to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> directly connects to <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\text{.}\)</span>  Instead, we still need to show that the <em class="emphasis">next</em> element in the sequence <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true by appealing to a previous element in the sequence.</p>
<p>Relevant examples are those like the binary representation of a number - that <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> has a binary representation doesn't immediately tell us <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> does, but if we can cut the number in half and use the binary representation of that number to scale-up in order to build a binary representation of <span class="process-math">\(k+1\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_logic_induction.html#note-19" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
