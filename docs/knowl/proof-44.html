<p>Question: You have a large container filled with ping-pong balls, all with a different number on them. You must select <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of the balls, putting two of them in a jar and the others in a box. How many ways can you do this?</p>
<p>Answer 1: First select 2 of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> balls to put in the jar. Then select <span class="process-math">\(k-2\)</span> of the remaining <span class="process-math">\(n-2\)</span> balls to put in the box. The first task can be completed in <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 2}\)</span> different ways, the second task in <span class="process-math">\({n-2 \choose k-2}\)</span> ways. Thus there are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose 2}{n-2 \choose k-2}\)</span> ways to select the balls.</p>
<p>Answer 2: First select <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> balls from the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in the container. Then pick 2 of the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> balls you picked to put in the jar, placing the remaining <span class="process-math">\(k-2\)</span> in the box. The first task can be completed in <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> ways, the second task in <span class="process-math">\({k \choose 2}\)</span> ways. Thus there are <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}{k \choose 2}\)</span> ways to select the balls.</p>
<p>Since both answers count the same thing, they must be equal and the identity is established.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-counting-binomial.html#proof-44" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
