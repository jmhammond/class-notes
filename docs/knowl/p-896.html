<div class="para">Assume, to the contrary, that every prime divisor of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is greater than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is composite, it has at least two prime factors, <span class="process-math">\(p_1, p_2\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(n = p_1 p_2 b\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is some  positive integer. But since <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \and p_2\)</span> are a prime divisors of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> by our assumption, <span class="process-math">\(p_1 \gt \sqrt{n} \and p_2 \gt \sqrt{n}\text{.}\)</span> So:</div>

\begin{equation*}

This means our original assumption, that every prime factor of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> was greater than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> was wrong, and therefore we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has a prime factor less than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\text{.}\)</span>
