      <statement>
        <p>
          A standard deck of playing cards contains four <term>suits</term> (spade, heart, club, diamond). There are 13 cards in each suit (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace). <term>Face cards</term> refers to jacks, queens, and kings. Spades and clubs are black and hearts and diamonds are red.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>multiplicative principle</term> states that if an event <m>A</m> can occur <m>m</m> ways and an event <m>B</m> can occur <n>n</n> ways, then the event <q><m>A \and B</m></q> can occur <m>m\cdot n</m> ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The multiplicative principle generalizes to more than two events.
        </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          If in your closet you have five ironic t-shirts, three pairs of pants, and three collegiate hats, how many different outfits do you have? Here an outfit is pants, shirt, hat.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many six character license plates can there be if the first three characters are letters and the second three characters are numbers?

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>additive principle</term> states that if event <m>A</m> can occur <m>m</m> ways and event <m>B</m> can occur <m>n</m> ways and the two events are disjoint, then the event <q><m>A \text{ or } B</m></q> can occur <m>m + n</m> ways.

      <title>Counting principles in terms of sets:</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A \and B</m> be two sets. Then:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|</m>.

      <title>The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A \and B</m> are two sets, then <m>|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this is like the additive principle, except we're removing the occurances that are in common between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>


    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose a company receives 350 applications from college graduates for a job. Suppose 220 of these applicants majored in computer science, 147 majored in business, and 51 majored in both computer science and business. How many majored in neither computer science nor business? 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many bit strings of length eight either start with a 1 bit or end with two bits 00? 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>



    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are 30 people in a club. Assuming everyone is qualified to serve in any position, how many different ways are there to assign a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>


    <note>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion applies to more than two sets. For any finite sets <m>A, B, \and C</m>,
          <me> |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </note>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we surveyed a class of 41 students, asking if they could play an Accordion, a Bassoon, or a Clarinet. 12 could play the clarinet, 8 could play bassoon, and 5 the accordian. 6 played clarinet and bassoon, 2 played clarinet and accordion, and 3 played bassoon and accordion. One student played all three. 
        </p>
        <p>
          How many students can play at least one instrument? Solve this first by Venn Diagrams, then by PIE.

      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>k</m> is a positive integer and <m>k+1</m> objects are placed into <m>k</m> boxes, then at least one box has two or more objects.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <statement>
        <p>

      <title>The Generalized Pigeonhole Principal</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>N</m> objects are placed into <m>k</m> boxes, then there is at least one box with <m>\left\lceil \dfrac{N}{k} \right\rceil</m>.

          How many cards must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards in order that at least three have the same suit? 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        According to the Generalized Pigeonhole Principle, we want to determine the number of cards, <m>N</m>, that must be drawn (here <m>k = 4</m> suits):
        <me> \left\lceil \dfrac{N}{4} \right\rceil \ge 3</me>

        <solution>
          <p>
            There are a total of four different remainders modulo 4. According to the Generalized Pigenhole Principal, if we have 5 numbers divided among four different remainders, <m>\left\lceil \dfrac{5}{4} \right\rceil = 2</m> of them have to have the same remainder. Thus they differ by a multiple of four.

            A combination lock consists of a dial with 40 numbers on it.

The numbers must be distinct. How many different combinations are possible?

      <title>The Binomial Theorem and Binomial Coefficients</title>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Expand the binomial: <m>(x+y)^3</m>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Everyone and their pet cat will give the correct answer: <m>x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is this the case? Each term has some amount of <m>x</m>'s and <m>y</m>'s. The coefficient of the <m>x^{3-k}y^k</m> term is counting the number of terms that have <m>y^k</m>
            <m>
              (x+y)^3 = \binom30 x^3y^0 + \binom31 x^2y^1 + \binom32 x^1y^2 + \binom33 x^0y^3

      <!-- the following is adapted from https://github.com/oscarlevin/discrete-book -->
      <p>
        Let's arrange the binomial coefficients <m>{n \choose k}</m> into a triangle like follows:
      </p>
      <sidebyside width="80%">
        <image xml:id="pascal-small">
          <description>Pascal's triangle</description>
          <latex-image>
            \begin{tikzpicture}
            \def\r{.5}

            % Pascal's triangle
            %put row of 1's down left side:
            \foreach \row in {0,...,7} {
            \hexbox{\row}{0}{ 1}
            }
            %fill in the rest of the triangle:
            \foreach \row in {1,...,7} {
            \pgfmathsetmacro{\entry}{1};
            \foreach \col in {1,...,\row} {
            % iterative formula : val = precval * (row-col+1)/col
            % (+ 0.5 to bypass rounding errors)
            \pgfmathtruncatemacro{\entry}{\entry*((\row-\col+1)/\col)+0.5};
            \global\let\entry=\entry
            \ifnum \entry&lt;100
            \hexbox{\row}{\col}{\entry}
            \else \ifnum \entry&lt;1000
            \hexbox{\row}{\col}{\footnotesize \entry}
            \else \ifnum \entry&lt;10000
            \hexbox{\row}{\col}{\footnotesize \entry}
            \else
            \hexbox{\row}{\col}{\scriptsize \entry}
            \fi
            \fi
            \fi
            }
            }
            \end{tikzpicture}
          </latex-image>
        </image>
      </sidebyside>
      <p>
        There are lots of patterns hidden away in the triangle, enough to fill a reasonably sized book. Here are just a few of the most obvious ones:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The entries on the border of the triangle are all 1.
              <me>\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1</me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any entry not on the border is the sum of the two entries above it.
              <me>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The triangle is symmetric.  In any row, entries on the left side are mirrored on the right side.
              <me> \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n - k}</me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The sum of all entries on a given row is a power of 2. 
              <me> \binom{n}0 + \binom{n}1 + \binom{n}2 + \dots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n</me>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      
      <p>
        Our goal for the remainder of the section is to give proofs of binomial identities.
      </p>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Give an algebraic proof for the binomial identity
            <me>
              {n \choose k} = {n-1\choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}.
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <proof>
            <p>
              By the definition of <m>{n \choose k}</m>, we have
              <me>
              {n-1 \choose k-1} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-1-(k-1))!(k-1)!} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!(k-1)!}</me>
              and
              <me> {n-1 \choose k} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-1-k)!k!}.
              </me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, starting with the right-hand side of the equation:
              <md>
                <mrow> {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k} \amp = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!(k-1)!}+ \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-1-k)!\,k!}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \frac{(n-1)!k}{(n-k)!\,k!} + \frac{(n-1)!(n-k)}{(n-k)!\,k!}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \frac{(n-1)!(k+n-k)}{(n-k)!\,k!}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!\, k!}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = {n \choose k}.</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>

            <p>
              The second line (where the common denominator is found) works because <m>k(k-1)! = k!</m> and <m>(n-k)(n-k-1)! = (n-k)!</m>.
            </p>
          </proof>
        </solution>
      </example>


      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Give a combinotarial proof of the identity:
            <me>
              {n \choose k} = {n-1\choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}.
            </me>
            by viewing the binomial coefficients as counting subsets.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We begin by asking a question, and answering the question in two ways:
          </p>
          <p>
            <q>How many subsets of size <m>k</m> are there from a set of size <m>n</m>?</q>
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer one: There are <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> such subsets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer two: Pick any element of the set. That element is either included in a subset, or it is not.
            <ul>
              <li> How many subsets contain this element? We will be picking from the remaining <m>n-1</m> elements. Since we want the subsets to have <m>k</m> elements, but we already have one of them, we have a total of <m>\binom{n-1}{k-1}</m> such subsets. </li>
              <li> How many subsets <emph>do not</emph> contain this element? We will be picking from the remaining <m>n-1</m> elements. Since we want the subsets to have <m>k</m> elements, we have <m>\binom{n-1}{k}</m> such subsets. </li>
            </ul>
            Thus there are <m>\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</m> subsets of <m>k</m> elements from a set of <m>n</m> elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because each answer counted the same objects, but in two different ways, those answers much be the same. Thus 
            <me>
              {n \choose k} = {n-1\choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}.
            </me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

        <statement>
          <p>

          </p>
        </statement>

          <proof>
            <p>
              Question: How many 2-letter words start with <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, or <em>c</em> and end with either <em>y</em> or <em>z</em>?
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 1: There are two words that start with <em>a</em>, two that start with <em>b</em>, two that start with <em>c</em>, for a total of <m>2+2+2</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 2: There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for the second letter, for a total of <m>3 \cdot 2</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since the two answers are both answers to the same question, they are equal. Thus <m>2 + 2 + 2 = 3\cdot 2</m>.

          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>

          <proof>
            <p>
              Question: How many subsets of <m>A = {1,2,3, \ldots, n+1}</m> contain exactly two elements?
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 1: We must choose 2 elements from <m>n+1</m> choices, so there are <m>{n+1 \choose 2}</m> subsets.
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 2: We break this question down into cases, based on what the larger of the two elements in the subset is. The larger element can't be 1, since we need at least one element smaller than it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Larger element is 2: there is 1 choice for the smaller element.
            </p>

            <p>
              Larger element is 3: there are 2 choices for the smaller element.
            </p>

            <p>
              Larger element is 4: there are 3 choices for the smaller element.
            </p>

            <p>
              And so on. When the larger element is <m>n+1</m>, there are <m>n</m> choices for the smaller element. Since each two element subset must be in exactly one of these cases, the total number of two element subsets is <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 1 and answer 2 are both correct answers to the same question, so they must be equal. Therefore,
              <me>
                1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = {n+1 \choose 2}

            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 1: First select 2 of the <m>n</m> balls to put in the jar. Then select <m>k-2</m> of the remaining <m>n-2</m> balls to put in the box. The first task can be completed in <m>{n \choose 2}</m> different ways, the second task in <m>{n-2 \choose k-2}</m> ways. Thus there are <m>{n \choose 2}{n-2 \choose k-2}</m> ways to select the balls.
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 2: First select <m>k</m> balls from the <m>n</m> in the container. Then pick 2 of the <m>k</m> balls you picked to put in the jar, placing the remaining <m>k-2</m> in the box. The first task can be completed in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways, the second task in <m>{k \choose 2}</m> ways. Thus there are <m>{n \choose k}{k \choose 2}</m> ways to select the balls.

            The word contains 9 letters: 3 <q>r</q>s, 2 <q>a</q>s and 2 <q>e</q>s, along with an <q>n</q> and a <q>g</q>. We could first select the positions for the <q>r</q>s in <m>{9 \choose 3}</m> ways, then the <q>a</q>s in <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> ways, the <q>e</q>s in <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> ways and then select one of the remaining two spots to put the <q>n</q> (placing the <q>g</q> in the last spot). This gives the answer

          <p>
            Alternatively, we could select the positions of the letters in the opposite order, which would give an answer

              Question: How many <m>k</m>-letter words can you make using <m>n</m> different letters without repeating any letter?
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 1: There are <m>n</m> choices for the first letter, <m>n-1</m> choices for the second letter, <m>n-2</m> choices for the third letter, and so on until <m>n - (k-1)</m> choices for the <m>k</m>th letter (since <m>k-1</m> letters have already been assigned at that point). The product of these numbers can be written <m>\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m> which is <m>P(n,k)</m>.  Therefore there are <m>P(n,k)</m> words.
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 2: First pick <m>k</m> letters to be in the word from the <m>n</m> choices. This can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways. Now arrange those letters into a word. There are <m>k</m> choices for the first letter, <m>k-1</m> choices for the second, and so on, for a total of <m>k!</m> arrangements of the <m>k</m> letters. Thus the total number of words is <m>{n \choose k}k!</m>.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 1: We choose 5 out of the <m>n+3</m> elements, so <m>{n+3 \choose 5}</m> subsets.
            </p>

            <p>
              Answer 2: Break this up into cases by what the <q>middle</q> (third smallest) element of the 5 element subset is. The smallest this could be is a 3. In that case, we have <m>{2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the numbers below it, and <m>{n \choose 2}</m> choices for the numbers above it. Alternatively, the middle number could be a 4. In this case there are <m>{3 \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and <m>{n-1 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top two numbers. If the middle number is 5, then there are <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and <m>{n-2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top two numbers. An so on, all the way up to the largest the middle number could be, which is <m>n+1</m>. In that case there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and <m>{2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top number. Thus the number of 5 element subsets is

      <solution>
        <p>
          We know that a 5-board is just a 4-board with an extra space. How many ways are there to tile this? There are 5 ways to tile a 4-board and all we're doing is adding an extra square. There's <m>5\cdot1 = 1</m> ways to do this. 
        </p>
        <p>
          ... but a 5-board is also a 3-board with an extra two spaces at the end. How many ways can we tile this? Well, there are 3 ways to tile the three board, and we just add a domino.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two subdivisions are mutually exclusive (if we added a square to the 3-board, that's turned it into the 4-board, which was already counted above). So we can conclude the number of ways to tile a 5-board is 5+3 = 8.

      Let's put this to use to verify some Fibonacci identities using combinatorial proof. When we write <term>condition on <m>m</m></term> we mean to consider <q>breaking</q> the board at tile <m>m</m> and count the separate pieces.

      We say that a tiling of an <m>n</m>-board is <term>breakable at cell <m>k</m></term>, if the tiling can be decomposed into two tilings, one covering cells 1 through <m>k</m>, the other <m>k+1</m> through <m>n</m>. It is said to be <term>unbreakable at <m>k</m></term> otherwise.

    <!-- This exercise comes from an identity in Proofs that Really Count -->

        <p>
          For <m>n \ge 0,\, \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n-n}{n} = f_n</m>.

        <p>
          Note that we'll define <m>\binom{n}{k} = 0</m> if <m>n \lt k</m>. This is reasonable since, for example, if you want to choose 3 objects from a set of 1 object, there are no ways to do it: i.e. <m>\binom{1}{3} = 0</m>.

          Question: <q>How many tilings of an <m>n</m>-board exist?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 1: There are <m>f_n</m> tilings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 2: Condition on the number of dominoes. If there are no dominoes, then from <m>n</m> cells, we have 0 choices for where to put the domino: <m>\binom{n}{0}</m>. For 1 domino, we will be using a total of <m>n-2</m> squares and domino which will span the remaining two locations. That means that we are using a total of <m>n-1</m> tiles, and so we have <m>\binom{n-1}{1}</m> possibilities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For the case where we are using <m>i</m> dominoes, with <m>0\le i \le n/2</m>, we will be using  <m>n-2i</m> squares, or a total of <m>n-2i + i = n-i</m> tiles. To choose where to place the <m>i</m> dominoes, we'll have <m>\binom{n-i}{i}</m> ways to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, there are a total of <m>n \ge 0, \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n-n}{n}</m> tilings of an <m>n</m> board.
        </p>
      </solution>
