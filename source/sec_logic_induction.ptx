  <title>Mathematical Induction</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we consider statements which involve some form of <q>... is true of every integer</q>. For example,
      <ul>
        <li> For every integer <m>n \ge 1</m>, <m>\ds 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>. </li>
        <li> <m>\log(a^n) = n \log (a)</m> for every positive integer <m>n</m></li>
      </ul>
      These are sequences of statements and we'll be using a recursive technique to prove them, because we can't prove that a statement like this is true by showing it's true for every literal integer (there are infinitely many of them, so that's impossible). Instead, the principle of mathematical induction tells us we <em>can</em> prove statements like these are true, so long as we do it just right. This section helps us learn how to do just that.

          To prove that a statement <m>P(n)</m> is true for all integers <m>n\ge 0</m>, we use the <term>principle of math induction</term>. The process has two core steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Basis step: Prove that <m>P(0)</m> is true.</li>
            <li>Inductive step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some value of <m>k \ge 0</m> and show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. </li>
          </ol>

      The common analogy for induction is to imagine an infinite ladder. First, you put your foot on the bottom rung. If you're able to go from the <m>k</m>-th rung to the <m>k+1</m>-st rung, you'll be able to climb forever.

          What is wrong with the following <q>proof</q> that all horses are the same color?

        <p>
          Proof by induction:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> Base step: the statement <m>P(1)</m> is the statement <q>one horse is the same color as itself</q>. This is clearly true.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> Induction step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some integer <m>k</m>. That is, any group of <m>k</m> horses are all the same color.</p>
              <p> Consider a group of <m>k+1</m> horses. Let's line them up. If we look at first <m>k</m> horses, our induction hypothesis tells us they are the same color. Similarly, if we look at the last <m>k</m> horses, they are also the same color. This shows that all <m>k+1</m> horses are the same color.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Thus, by math induction, all horses are the same color.

      <solution>
        <p>
          Here's one way to approach the problem. Begin by showing we can do the basis, see if we can find a pattern, then make a formal proof:
          <ul>
            <li> <m>18 = 7\cdot2 + 4\cdot1</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>19 = 7\cdot1 + 4\cdot3</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>20 = 7\cdot0 + 4\cdot5</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>21 = 7\cdot3 + 4\cdot0</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>22 = 7\cdot2 + 4\cdot2</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>23 = 7\cdot1 + 4\cdot4</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>24 = 7\cdot0 + 4\cdot6</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>25 = 7\cdot3 + 4\cdot1</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>26 = 7\cdot2 + 4\cdot3</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>27 = 7\cdot1 + 4\cdot5</m>  </li>
            <li> <m>28 = 7\cdot0 + 4\cdot7</m>  </li>
          </ul>
          Do you notice a pattern? Take a couple moments to think about it, then let's do the proof.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Basis step: We can form 18 cent postage using two 7 and one 4 cent stamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inductive step:
            Assume that one can form postage for all values from 18 cents up to <m>k</m> cents. Now we're asked to form <m>k+1</m> cents.

            we know that we can form <m>k</m> cents, so, without loss of generality, let's assume that it takes <m>s</m> 7 cent stamps and <m>t</m> 4 cent stamps. That is:
            <me>
              k = 7s + 4t
            </me>

            Now, if <m>s \ge 1</m>, then we can do the following, adding one to both sides in two different ways:
            <me> k+1 = 7s + 4t - 7 + 8</me>
            Combining like terms we have
            <me> k+1 = 7(s-1) + 4(t+2)</me>

            If, on the other hand, <m>s=0</m>, then we need to add one in a different way:
            <me> k+1 = 7s + 4t + 21 - 20 </me>
            or, combining like terms:
            <me> k+1 = 7(s+3) + 4(t-5)</me>

            Thus, by inductive hypothesis, if we can form <m>k</m> cents, I can form <m>k+1</m> cents postage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, by mathematical induction, every postage cost greater than or equal to 18 can be formed using 4 and 7 cent stamps.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </solution>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Here's a different approach to the problem. If we can construct <m>18, 19, 20, \dots k</m> postage using the four and seven cent stamps, then for the <m>k+1</m> cent postage, We'll just pretend you asked for four cents less! $k+1 -4 = k-3$. Were're guaranteed to be able to make the postage by the induction hypothesis. Imagine putting those stamps on the package. Then all we need is to glue on one four cent stamp and we're good to go!

      <title>The difference between 'weak' and 'strong' induction</title>
      <p>
        'Regular'/'weak' induction follows the pattern:
        <ol>
          <li>Basis step.</li>
          <li>Inductive hypothesis is <m>P(k)</m> is true</li>
          <li>We show that <m>P(k)</m> implies that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true</li>
        </ol>
        That is, we use this induction process for claims where it's convenient to show that the pattern follows sequentially in a convenient way. Straight-forward examples are the addition formulas;
      </p>
      <p>
        'Strong' induction follows the pattern:
        <ol>
          <li>Basis step(s).   [may need more than one basis, just like some recurrence relations]</li>
          <li>
          Inductive hypothesis is that <em>all</em> of <m>P(1), P(2), P(3), \dots P(k)</m> are true.   [this is the 'strong' part; it's a larger assumption]</li>
          <li>We show that the hypothesis implies the next element in the sequence, <m>P(k+1)</m>, is true  [like before]</li>
        </ol>
        the difference between this and the previous induction process is that it's sometimes <em>not convenient</em> to prove that <m>P(k)</m> directly connects to <m>P(k+1)</m>.  Instead, we still need to show that the <em>next</em> element in the sequence <m>P(k+1)</m> is true by appealing to a previous element in the sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relevant examples are those like the binary representation of a number - that <m>k</m> has a binary representation doesn't immediately tell us <m>k+1</m> does, but if we can cut the number in half and use the binary representation of that number to scale-up in order to build a binary representation of <m>k+1</m>.
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      We separate 'weak' and 'strong' induction, but they're really all the same thing. It's just that when it's convenient to show <m>P(k) \to P(k+1)</m>, we write fewer words for our inductive hypothesis. Because if we don't need to use the fact that <m>P(m)</m> is true for all <m>1 \le m \le k</m>, then we just omit that. Mathematicians are lazy.

      You'll be using mathematical induction when you're designing algorithms. Let's take the example of sorting a dataset. To prove that an algorithm is correct, you need:
      <ol>
        <li> There is a valid base case. In our example - it can sort a set of one element) </li>
        <li> Assume the algorithm works for <m>n</m> objects. It can sort a set of <m>n</m> objects</li>
        <li> Show that if you have a larger set of one more object, <m>n+1</m> objects, your algorithm correctly sorts that new elements with the previous <m>n</m> elements. It can sort a set with <m>n+1</m> objects. Therefore, the algorithm is correct.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we proved mathematically in <xref ref="example-postage"/> that any postage over 18 cents can be made with 4 and 7 cent stamps.
      The proof of that gives rise to an algorithm that we know must be correct:
    </p>
    <sage language="python">
        <input>
          # input: n cents postage
          # output: A string telling you what to pay

              x = 18
              s = 2
              t = 1  #base case with:  18 = 7s + 4t
              while x &lt; n:
                  x +=1 #get get the "x+1" case, we need to either:
                  if s >= 1:
                       s-=1  # subtract 7
                       t+=2  # add two 4s, since -7 + 2*4 = 8, a net gain of 1
                  else:
                       s+=3  # add 7*3 = 21
                       t-=5  # remove 20: 4*5 = 20; net gain of 1 = 21 - 20

          Use induction to prove for all <m>n \in \N</m> that <m>\d 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We must prove that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \cdots +2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>. Thus let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>, which claims that <m>1 = 2^{0+1} -1</m>. Since <m>2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1</m>, we see that <m>P(0)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>. That is, <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1</m>. We must show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true (i.e., that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} - 1</m>). To do this, we start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
            <md>

              <mrow> \amp ~ 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp=   2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^{k+1} \amp \text{by inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 2\cdot 2^{k+1} - 1 \amp</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp=  2^{k+2} - 1 \amp</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true so by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1+3 +5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>. First the base case, <m>P(1)</m>. We have <m>1 = 1^2</m> which is true, so <m>P(1)</m> is established. Now the inductive case. Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some fixed arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>. That is, <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2</m>. We will now prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true (i.e., that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k+1) = (k+1)^2</m>). We start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>2^n \lt  n!</m>. We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 4</m>. First, we check the base case and see that yes, <m>2^4 \lt  4!</m> (as <m>16 \lt  24</m>) so <m>P(4)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \ge 4</m>. That is, <m>2^k \lt  k!</m>. Now consider <m>P(k+1)</m>: <m>2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!</m>. To prove this, we start with the left side and work to the right side.

        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>n \lt  100</m>. We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case: when <m>n = 0</m>, <m>P(n)</m> is true, because <m>0 \lt  100</m>. Now for the inductive step, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>k \lt  100</m>. Now if <m>k \lt  100</m>, then <m>k</m> is some number, like 80. Of course <m>80+1 = 81</m> which is still less than 100. So <m>k +1 \lt  100</m> as well. But this is what <m>P(k+1)</m> claims, so we have shown that <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

        <p>
          The problem here is that while <m>P(0)</m> is true, and while <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> for <em>some</em> values of <m>k</m>, there is at least one value of <m>k</m> (namely <m>k = 99</m>) when that implication fails. For a valid proof by induction, <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> must be true for all values of <m>k</m> greater than or equal to the base case.

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q><m>n^2 + n</m> is odd.</q> We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

By the inductive hypothesis, <m>k^2 + k</m> is odd, and of course <m>2k + 2</m> is even. An odd plus an even is always odd, so therefore <m>(k+1)^2 + (k+1)</m> is odd.

          </p>
          <p>
            Inductive step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some integer <m>k \ge 0</m>, that is, <m>k^2 + k</m> is even, and let's consider the following:

              <mrow> \amp = k^2 + k + 2k + 2 </mrow>
            </md>
            now <m>k^2 + k = 2l</m> for some integer <m>l</m> by inductive hypothesis, so we have:

            and thus <m>(k+1)^2 + (k+1)</m> is even.

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>when <m>n</m> people shake hands with each other, there are a total of <m>\frac{n(n-1)}{2}</m> handshakes.</q>
          </p>

          <p>
            Base case: When <m>n=2</m>, there will be one handshake, and <m>\frac{2(2-1)}{2} = 1</m>.  Thus <m>P(2)</m> is true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inductive case: Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for arbitrary <m>k\ge 2</m> (that the number of handshakes among <m>k</m> people is <m>\frac{k(k-1)}{2}</m>.  What happens if a <m>k+1</m>st person shows up?  How many <em>new</em> handshakes take place?  The new person must shake hands with everyone there, which is <m>k</m> new  handshakes.  So the total is now <m>\frac{k(k-1)}{2} + k = \frac{(k+1)k}{2}</m>, as needed.
          </p>

          The idea here is that if we take the logarithm of <m>a^n</m>, we can increase <m>n</m> by 1 if we multiply by another <m>a</m> (inside the logarithm). This results in adding 1 more <m>\log(a)</m> to the total.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>\log(a^n) = n \log(a)</m>. The base case, <m>P(2)</m> is true, because <m>\log(a^2) = \log(a\cdot a) = \log(a) + \log(a) = 2\log(a)</m>, by the product rule for logarithms. Now assume, for induction, that <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>\log(a^k) = k\log(a)</m>. Consider <m>\log(a^{k+1})</m>. We have
            <me>
              \log(a^{k+1}) = \log(a^k\cdot a) = \log(a^k) + \log(a) = k\log(a) + \log(a)
            </me>
            with the last equality due to the inductive hypothesis. But this simplifies to <m>(k+1) \log(a)</m>, establishing <m>P(k+1)</m>. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove, using strong induction, that every natural number is either a Fibonacci number or can be written as the <em>sum</em> of <em>distinct</em> Fibonacci numbers.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement that <m>n</m> is either a Fibonacci number of the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers
          </p>
          <p>
            Basis step: For <m>n=0</m>, we have that <m>0 = F_0</m> is a Fibonacci number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inductive step: Assume that there is an integer <m>k \ge 0</m> such that <m>P(m)</m> is true for all <m>0\le m \le k</m>. That is, <m>m</m> is either a Fibonacci number or the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers. Now let's consider the next number, <m>k+1</m>:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case 1: If <m>k+1</m> is a Fibonacci number, then we're done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case 2: If <m>k+1</m> is not a Fibonacci number, then let <m>F_m</m> be the largest Fibonacci number less than <m>k+1</m>. Since <m>k+1 - F_m \le k</m> then we have that <m>k+1 - F_m</m> is the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers, by inductive hypothesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding <m>F_m</m> to this sum gives us <m>k+1 - F_m + F_m = k+1</m> which then itself a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, by induction, every natural number is either a Fibonacci number of the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.

            Basis step: If <m>n =1</m> then <m>F_1 =1</m> and <m>F_{2\cdot 1} = 1</m> so that <m>P(1)</m> is true.

          <p>
            Inductive step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some integer <m>k\ge 1</m>. That is, <m>F_1 + F_3 + F_5 + \dots + F_{2k -1} = F_{2k}</m> and consider:

(By <term>strictly increasing</term> we mean <m>a_n \lt  a_{n+1}</m> for all <m>n</m>. So each term must be larger than the last.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>there is a strictly increasing sequence <m>a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n</m> with <m>a_n \lt  100</m>.</q> We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>. First we establish the base case: <m>P(1)</m> says there is a single number <m>a_1</m> with <m>a_1 \lt  100</m>. This is true <ndash/> take <m>a_1 = 0</m>. Now for the inductive step, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is there exists a strictly increasing sequence <m>a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_k</m> with <m>a_k \lt  100</m>. Now consider this sequence, plus one more term, <m>a_{k+1}</m> which is greater than <m>a_k</m> but less than <m>100</m>. Such a number exists, for example, the average between <m>a_k</m> and 100. So then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true, so we have shown that <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

          Prove that 6 divides <m>7^n - 1</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          (Alternative idea to the below proof) In the inductive step add and subtract <m>7^k</m>. That is, you'll have <m>7\cdot 7^{k} - 1 - 7^k + 7^k</m>. Now algebra.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>6 divides <m>7^n - 1</m>.</q> We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>. Since <m>7^0 - 1 = 0</m>, and <m>0</m> is a multiple of 6, <m>P(0)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> holds for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>. That is, 6 divides <m>7^k - 1</m>, or in other words, <m>7^k - 1 = 6j</m> for some integer <m>j</m>. Now consider <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow> 7^{k+1} - 1 ~ \amp = 7^{k+1} - 7 + 6 \amp \text{by cleverness:} -1 = -7 + 6</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 7(7^k - 1) + 6 \amp \text{factor out a 7 from the first two terms}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 7(6j) + 6 \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 6(7j + 1) \amp \text{factor out a 6}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore 6 divides <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m>, or in other words, <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
