    The Multiplicative and Additive Principles
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we begin our quest to start answering a question that sounds simple enough: <q>how many elements are in a set?</q>  Counting the number of sets is common enough that we gave it its own symbol, <m>|S|</m>, in <xref ref="sec_objects_sets"/>. Numbers of elements in the domain and codomain of functions determine whether a function is bijective, as we saw in <xref ref="exercise-cardinality-of-domain-codomain" text="custom">an exercise in the functions section</xref>
    </p>
    <p>
      We start with basic counting rules that help us count <m>|A\times B|</m> and <m>|A\cup B|</m> for sets <m>A \and B</m>.
    </p>

      <p>
        It's common to count <q>hands of cards,</q> so we'll note that a standard deck of playing cards contains four <term>suits</term> (spade, heart, club, diamond). There are 13 cards in each suit (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace). <term>Face cards</term> refers to jacks, queens, and kings. Spades and clubs are black and hearts and diamonds are red.
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      Our first principle counts <m>A\times B</m>:
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>Multiplication Principle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>multiplication principle</term> states that if an event <m>A</m> can occur <m>m</m> ways and an event <m>B</m> can occur <m>n</m> ways, then the event <q><m>A \and B</m></q> can occur <m>m\cdot n</m> ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The multiplication principle generalizes to more than two events.

      Our second principle (almost) counts <m>A\cup B</m>; we need <m>A \and B</m> to be disjoint sets.

      <title>Addition Principle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>addition principle</term> states that if event <m>A</m> can occur <m>m</m> ways and event <m>B</m> can occur <m>n</m> ways and the two events are disjoint, then the event <q><m>A \text{ or } B</m> (but not both)</q> can occur <m>m + n</m> ways.

    <definition>
      <title>Counting principles in terms of sets:</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A \and B</m> be two sets. Then:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>, then <m>|A\cup B| = |A| + |B|</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      In order to count <m>A\cup B</m>, regardless of how the two sets intersect, we introduce the following:
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A \and B</m> are two sets, then <m>|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this is like the additive principle, except we're removing the occurrences that are in common between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      It helps, when working counting problems with unions, even if using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, to draw a Venn diagram and label the number of elements in each section.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose a company receives 350 applications from college graduates for a job. Suppose 220 of these applicants majored in computer science, 147 majored in business, and 51 majored in both computer science and business. How many majored in neither computer science nor business?

    <p>
      The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion applies to more than two sets. For any finite sets <m>A, B, \and C</m>,
      <me> |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|</me>
      In fact, we could generalize it further, but I'll leave that to you to write the formula if you're interested.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we surveyed a class of 41 students, asking if they could play an Accordion, a Bassoon, or a Clarinet. 12 could play the clarinet, 8 could play bassoon, and 5 the accordion. 6 played clarinet and bassoon, 2 played clarinet and accordion, and 3 played bassoon and accordion. One student played all three.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many students can play at least one instrument? Solve this first by Venn Diagrams, then by PIE.

      Our next counting approach is pretty straight forward. If you have three cookies, but only two plates, you know that one person is eaching at least two cookies.

      I'll pause here to note that a <q>pigeonhole</q> is a slot on a desk or shelf for holding papers. In our scenario, if we have five slots in our desk to hold our papers, and six papers, one slot has at least two papers.

        <p>
          <m>\card{A \cup B} + \card{A \cap B} = 13</m>.  Use PIE: we know <m>\card{A \cup B} = 8 + 5 - \card{A \cap B}</m>.

          In a recent survey, 30 students reported whether they liked their potatoes Mashed, French-fried, or Twice-baked. 15 liked them mashed, 20 liked French fries, and 9 liked twice baked potatoes. Additionally, 12 students liked both mashed and fried potatoes, 5 liked French fries and twice baked potatoes, 6 liked mashed and baked, and 3 liked all three styles. How many students
          <em>hate</em> potatoes? Explain why your answer is correct.

          There are a total of four different remainders modulo 4. According to the Generalized Pigeonhole Principal, if we have 5 numbers divided among four different remainders, <m>\left\lceil \dfrac{5}{4} \right\rceil = 2</m> of them have to have the same remainder. Thus they differ by a multiple of four.
