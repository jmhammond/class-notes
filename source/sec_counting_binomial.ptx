    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Expand the binomial: <m>(x+y)^3</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Everyone and their pet cat will give the correct answer: <m>x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this the case? Each term has some amount of <m>x</m>'s and <m>y</m>'s. The coefficient of the <m>x^{3-k}y^k</m> term is counting the number of terms that have <m>y^k</m>
          <m>
            (x+y)^3 = \binom30 x^3y^0 + \binom31 x^2y^1 + \binom32 x^1y^2 + \binom33 x^0y^3

    <title>Combinatorial Proofs</title>

    <!-- the following is adapted from https://github.com/oscarlevin/discrete-book -->
    <p>
      Let's arrange the binomial coefficients <m>{n \choose k}</m> into a triangle like follows:
    </p>
    <image xml:id="pascal-small" width="80%">
      <description>Pascal's triangle. Numbers are arranged in rows in the shape of a triangle. The top number is 1. Next row is 1 and 1; next row is 1, 2, 1; next is 1, 3, 3, 1; and it continues. Each entry is found by adding the two entries above it: e.g. 3=1+2</description>
      <latex-image>
        \begin{tikzpicture}
        \def\r{.5}

        % Pascal's triangle
        %put row of 1's down left side:
        \foreach \row in {0,...,7} {
        \hexbox{\row}{0}{ 1}
        }
        %fill in the rest of the triangle:
        \foreach \row in {1,...,7} {
        \pgfmathsetmacro{\entry}{1};
        \foreach \col in {1,...,\row} {
        % iterative formula : val = precval * (row-col+1)/col
        % (+ 0.5 to bypass rounding errors)
        \pgfmathtruncatemacro{\entry}{\entry*((\row-\col+1)/\col)+0.5};
        \global\let\entry=\entry
        \ifnum \entry&lt;100
        \hexbox{\row}{\col}{\entry}
        \else \ifnum \entry&lt;1000
        \hexbox{\row}{\col}{\footnotesize \entry}
        \else \ifnum \entry&lt;10000
        \hexbox{\row}{\col}{\footnotesize \entry}
        \else
        \hexbox{\row}{\col}{\scriptsize \entry}
        \fi
        \fi
        \fi
        }
        }
        \end{tikzpicture}
      </latex-image>
    </image>
    <p>
      There are lots of patterns hidden away in the triangle, enough to fill a reasonably sized book. Here are just a few of the most obvious ones:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The entries on the border of the triangle are all 1.
            <me>\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1</me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Any entry not on the border is the sum of the two entries above it.
            <me>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The triangle is symmetric.  In any row, entries on the left side are mirrored on the right side.
            <me> \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n - k}</me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The sum of all entries on a given row is a power of 2.
            <me> \binom{n}0 + \binom{n}1 + \binom{n}2 + \dots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n</me>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>


    <p>
      Our goal for the remainder of the section is to give proofs of binomial identities.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Give an algebraic proof for the binomial identity
          <me>
            {n \choose k} = {n-1\choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            By the definition of <m>{n \choose k}</m>, we have
            <me>
            {n-1 \choose k-1} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-1-(k-1))!(k-1)!} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!(k-1)!}</me>
            and
            <me> {n-1 \choose k} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-1-k)!k!}.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, starting with the right-hand side of the equation:
            <md>
              <mrow> {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k} \amp = \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!(k-1)!}+ \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-1-k)!\,k!}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{(n-1)!k}{(n-k)!\,k!} + \frac{(n-1)!(n-k)}{(n-k)!\,k!}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{(n-1)!(k+n-k)}{(n-k)!\,k!}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!\, k!}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = {n \choose k}.</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            The second line (where the common denominator is found) works because <m>k(k-1)! = k!</m> and <m>(n-k)(n-k-1)! = (n-k)!</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </solution>
    </example>


    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Give a combinatarial proof of the identity:
          <me>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We begin by asking a question, and answering the question in two ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>How many subsets of size <m>k</m> are there from a set of size <m>n</m>?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer one: There are <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> such subsets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer two: Pick any element of the set. That element is either included in a subset, or it is not.
          <ul>
            <li> How many subsets contain this element? We will be picking from the remaining <m>n-1</m> elements. Since we want the subsets to have <m>k</m> elements, but we already have one of them, we have a total of <m>\binom{n-1}{k-1}</m> such subsets. </li>
            <li> How many subsets <em>do not</em> contain this element? We will be picking from the remaining <m>n-1</m> elements. Since we want the subsets to have <m>k</m> elements, we have <m>\binom{n-1}{k}</m> such subsets. </li>
          </ul>
          Thus there are <m>\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</m> subsets of <m>k</m> elements from a set of <m>n</m> elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because each answer counted the same objects, but in two different ways, those answers much be the same. Thus
          <me>
            {n \choose k} = {n-1\choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>


    <note>
      <p>
        For a combinatorial proof:
        <ol>
          <li> Determine a question that can be answered by the particular equation.</li>
          <li> Answer the question in two different ways</li>
          <li> Because those answers count the same object, we can equate their solutions.</li>
        </ol>
        Coming up with the question is often the hardest part.
      </p>
    </note>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Give a combinatorial proof of the identities:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <m>\binom{n}0 = 1</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>
            </li>
          </ol>
          For each, what question should we answer?

          Give a combinatorial proof of the identity <m>2+2+2 = 3\cdot 2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Question: How many 2-letter words start with <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, or <em>c</em> and end with either <em>y</em> or <em>z</em>?
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 1: There are two words that start with <em>a</em>, two that start with <em>b</em>, two that start with <em>c</em>, for a total of <m>2+2+2</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 2: There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for the second letter, for a total of <m>3 \cdot 2</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the two answers are both answers to the same question, they are equal. Thus <m>2 + 2 + 2 = 3\cdot 2</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>

      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Give a combinatorial proof for the identity <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = {n+1 \choose 2}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Question: How many subsets of <m>A = \{1,2,3, \ldots, n+1\}</m> contain exactly two elements?
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 1: We must choose 2 elements from <m>n+1</m> choices, so there are <m>{n+1 \choose 2}</m> subsets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 2: We break this question down into cases, based on what the larger of the two elements in the subset is. The larger element can't be 1, since we need at least one element smaller than it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Larger element is 2: there is 1 choice for the smaller element.
          </p>

          <p>
            Larger element is 3: there are 2 choices for the smaller element.
          </p>

          <p>
            Larger element is 4: there are 3 choices for the smaller element.
          </p>

          <p>
            And so on. When the larger element is <m>n+1</m>, there are <m>n</m> choices for the smaller element. Since each two element subset must be in exactly one of these cases, the total number of two element subsets is <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 1 and answer 2 are both correct answers to the same question, so they must be equal. Therefore,
            <me>
              1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = {n+1 \choose 2}

          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 1: First select 2 of the <m>n</m> balls to put in the jar. Then select <m>k-2</m> of the remaining <m>n-2</m> balls to put in the box. The first task can be completed in <m>{n \choose 2}</m> different ways, the second task in <m>{n-2 \choose k-2}</m> ways. Thus there are <m>{n \choose 2}{n-2 \choose k-2}</m> ways to select the balls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 2: First select <m>k</m> balls from the <m>n</m> in the container. Then pick 2 of the <m>k</m> balls you picked to put in the jar, placing the remaining <m>k-2</m> in the box. The first task can be completed in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways, the second task in <m>{k \choose 2}</m> ways. Thus there are <m>{n \choose k}{k \choose 2}</m> ways to select the balls.

            Question: How many <m>k</m>-letter words can you make using <m>n</m> different letters without repeating any letter?
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 1: There are <m>n</m> choices for the first letter, <m>n-1</m> choices for the second letter, <m>n-2</m> choices for the third letter, and so on until <m>n - (k-1)</m> choices for the <m>k</m>th letter (since <m>k-1</m> letters have already been assigned at that point). The product of these numbers can be written <m>\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m> which is <m>P(n,k)</m>.  Therefore there are <m>P(n,k)</m> words.
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 2: First pick <m>k</m> letters to be in the word from the <m>n</m> choices. This can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways. Now arrange those letters into a word. There are <m>k</m> choices for the first letter, <m>k-1</m> choices for the second, and so on, for a total of <m>k!</m> arrangements of the <m>k</m> letters. Thus the total number of words is <m>{n \choose k}k!</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the two answers are correct answers to the same question, we have established that <m>P(n,k) = {n \choose k}k!</m>.

            Question: How many 5-element subsets are there of the set <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n+3\}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 1: We choose 5 out of the <m>n+3</m> elements, so <m>{n+3 \choose 5}</m> subsets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Answer 2: Break this up into cases by what the <q>middle</q> (third smallest) element of the 5 element subset is. The smallest this could be is a 3. In that case, we have <m>{2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the numbers below it, and <m>{n \choose 2}</m> choices for the numbers above it. Alternatively, the middle number could be a 4. In this case there are <m>{3 \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and <m>{n-1 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top two numbers. If the middle number is 5, then there are <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and <m>{n-2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top two numbers. An so on, all the way up to the largest the middle number could be, which is <m>n+1</m>. In that case there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and <m>{2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top number. Thus the number of 5 element subsets is
            <me>
              {2 \choose 2}{n \choose 2} + {3 \choose 2}{n-1 \choose 2} + {4\choose 2}{n-2 \choose 2} + \cdots + {n\choose 2}{2\choose 2}.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the two answers correctly answer the same question, we have
            <me>
              {2 \choose 2}{n \choose 2} + {3 \choose 2}{n-1 \choose 2} + {4\choose 2}{n-2 \choose 2} + \cdots + {n\choose 2}{2\choose 2} = {n+3 \choose 5}.

            <li> <m>(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \equiv x^2 + 1 \pmod 2 </m></li>
            <li> <m>(x+1)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 + 5x + 1 \equiv x^5 + 1 \pmod 5 </m></li>
