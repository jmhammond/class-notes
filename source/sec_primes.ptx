  <title>Prime Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Like atoms making up molecules, prime numbers are the fundamental building blocks of the integers.  In this section we see this in The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, and explore some interesting statements prime numbers. We conclude the section with primality testing -- how to determine if a number is prime.

    <title>Prime Numbers</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A positive integer <m>p</m> is called <term>prime</term> if the only positive factors of <m>p</m> are <m>1 \and p</m> itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        A positive integer which is not prime is called <m>composite</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The next logical question students ask is <q>what about 1?</q> because its only positive factors are 1 and itself. One is special.
  </p>

  <note>
    <title>1 is the loneliest number</title>
    <p>
      1 is neither prime nor composite. It's called a <term>unit</term>.
    </p>
  </note>

  <p>
    Our next proposition, along with the proof that <xref ref="ex-proof-sqrt2-irrational" text="custom">square root of 2 is irrational</xref>, is the most classic example of a proof by contradiction. It's hard (impossible?) to prove directly that there are infinitely many primes. Instead, we assume there are finitely many and then find a contradiction.
  </p>

  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are infinitely many primes.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume, to the contrary, that there are only finitely many primes. Let's call them <m>p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots p_n</m>. Consider the number
        <me>N = p_1 \cdot p_2\cdot  p_3 \cdots p_n + 1</me>
        the product of every prime, plus one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because <m>N</m> is larger than the largest prime, <m>p_n</m>, we know that <m>N</m> isn't in our list of primes and therefore is composite.  Then there is some prime <m>p_i</m> that divides it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But since <m>p_i \divides N</m> and <m>p_i \divides p_1\cdot  p_2\cdot  p_3 \cdots p_n</m>, we see that
        <me> p_i \divides (N - p_1 \cdot p_2\cdot  p_3 \cdots p_n)</me>
        meaning that
        <me>p_i \divides 1</me>
        But this is a contradiction since the only divisor of 1 is itself. Our assumption was incorrect, and therefore we conclude that there are infinitely many primes.
      </p>

  </proposition>

  <p>
    Over our school careers, we've been factoring numbers for a long time. You've probably noticed there is <q>a correct answer</q> when you produce a factorization. For example, we might write: <m>15 = 3\cdot 5</m> or <m>15 = 5\cdot 3</m>, these are the same factorization, we just changed the order we multiplied. The next theorem, which underlies all arithmetic, so we call it Fundament, tells us we <em>can</em> factor every integer and that there is really <em>a correct</em> answer.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <title>
      The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
    </title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes, and this product is unique up to the ordering of the prime factors.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <aside>
    <p>
      If 1 were called a prime number, the factorization wouldn't be unique. For example, we  could write 6 as:
      <m>6 = 2\cdot 3</m> or <m>6=1 \cdot 2\cdot 3</m> or <m>6=1\cdot 1 \cdot 2\cdot 3</m>, or <m>6=1\cdot 1\cdot 1 \cdot 2\cdot 3</m>...
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA) is a non-constructive statement. It tells us that we <em>can</em> write every positive integer as a unique product of primes, but it doesn't tell us <em>how</em>. Instead we need to use trial division and guess-and-check methods.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the prime factorization of the following:
        <ol>
          <li> 124 </li>
          <li> 81 </li>
          <li> 941 </li>
          <li> 3780</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Here are factor trees for each of the examples. To construct these, we divide each number by some prime factor and successively divide the remaining factor further until we're left with only prime factors.

    Trying to determine the prime factors of an integer can be really time consuming, especially if a number is prime. Fortunately, the next theorem tells us just how far we have to check in order to test primality or find a prime divisor.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-primes-under-sqrt">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>n</m> is a positive composite number, then <m>n</m> has a prime divisor less than or equal to <m>\sqrt{n}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <example>
    <title>Brute Force Trial Division</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        To determine if a number <m>n</m> is prime, one only needs to test all possible prime divisors up to <m>\sqrt{n}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use trial division to determine that 251 is prime.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Since <m>\sqrt{251} \approx 15.81</m>, we only need to check prime numbers which are less than 15. These are <m>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13</m> Since none of these divide into 251 evenly, we conclude that 251 is prime.

  <example xml:id="example-trial-division">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use trial division to determine if any of the following are prime:
        <ol>
          <li> 127 </li>
          <li> 143 </li>
          <li> 54323 </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li> Since, rounding down, <m>\sqrt{127} \approx 11</m>, we need only test primes up through 11.   Noticing that none of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11 divide evenly, we conclude 127 is prime. </li>
          <li>
            Here, <m>\sqrt{143} \approx 12</m> rounding up, so again we test only up through 11. We check that 2, 3, 5, 7 do not work but <m>143 = 11\cdot 13</m>, so we see that <m>143</m> is not a prime number.
          </li>
          <li>
            For <m>\sqrt{54321} \approx 233</m>, meaning we need to check every prime less than 233. In order to solve this, let's find a method to develop that list...

    <title>Sieve of Eratosthenes</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In order to generate a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to <m>n</m>, start with a tabular listing  of integers from 1 to <m>n</m> we run the following sieve or filter:
        <ol>
          <li> Cross off the number 1. </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Continuing until you reach <m>\sqrt{n}</m>:
              <ol>
                <li> Circle the next, non-crossed out number. It's prime. </li>

      Implementing the three step algorithm is very straight-forward.

        <li> Make a large list of integers </li>
        <li> Delete every multiple of of each prime we encounter</li>

      I'm choosing to implement this in Python in an inefficient, but readable way, so that we can run it in a Sage cell below. If you want to see it in your favorite language, you can find it implemented in many, many different languages on <url href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" visual="rosettacode.org/wiki/Sieve_Of_Eratosthenes">Rosetta Code</url>

        List lookup and removing items from lists is a very computationally expensive operation; on the order of <m>O(n)</m>. That said, I'm only demonstrating <q>small</q> examples for class, so I'm trading efficiency for clarity of the algorithm. In practice you'd want to use more efficient data structures.

          This question is of the form <q>if <m>n</m> is a prime number greater than three, then either <m>n=6k+1</m> or <m>n=6k-1</m> for some integer <m>k</m></q>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            (by contraposition). Assume that <m>n</m> is not a number of the form
            <m>n=6k+1</m> or <m>n=6k-1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. This gives us four total cases:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case 1: Assume <m>n=6k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Then <m>n</m> is not a prime number, since <m>n</m> is divisible by both 2 and 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case 2: Assume <m>n = 6k+2 = 2(3k+1)</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Then <m>n</m> is divisible by 2 and is hence not prime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case 3: assume <m>n = 6k+3 = 3(2k+1)</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. then <m>n</m> is divisible by 3 and is hence not prime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case 4: assume <m>n = 6k+4 = 2(3k+2)</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. then <m>n</m> is divisible by 2 and is hence not prime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus if <m>n</m> is not of the form <m>n=6k+1</m> or <m>n=6k-1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>, <m>n</m> is not prime. By contraposition, if <m>n</m> is a prime greater than three then <m>n</m> is of the form either <m>n=6k+1</m> or <m>n=6k-1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.

          What happens if we assume that every prime divisor of <m>n</m> is bigger than <m>\sqrt{n}</m>?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Our proof will go like this: factor <m>n</m> into three parts, <m>p_1, p_2, \and b</m> where <m>p_1 \and p_2</m> are prime and <m>b</m> is whatever is left with the factorization, such as <m>10 = 2\cdot5\cdot1</m> where <m>b=1</m> or <m>60=2\cdot5\cdot6</m> where <m>b=6</m>, but assuming those prime factors are bigger than <m>\sqrt{n}</m>, and look for the contradiction.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Assume, to the contrary, that every prime divisor of <m>n</m> is greater than <m>\sqrt{n}</m>. Since <m>n</m> is composite, it has at least two prime factors, <m>p_1, p_2</m> so that <m>n = p_1 p_2 b</m> where <m>b</m> is some  positive integer. But since <m>p_1 \and p_2</m> are a prime divisors of <m>n</m>, by our assumption, <m>p_1 \gt \sqrt{n} \and p_2 \gt \sqrt{n}</m>. So:
            <me> n = p_1  p_2  b \gt \sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot b = nb</me>
            But since <m>n\gt 1 </m> and <m>b\in \Z^+</m>, <m>n\gt nb</m> is a contradiction.
