    Permutations and Combinations
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous section, we were counting things that essentially occurred once. For example, we picked one outfit (one shirt, one pair of pants, one hat).  In this section we'll add complexity. Instead of picking an outfit for a day, how many different ways can our bag be packed for a weekend trip?  We'll answer it at the end of the section.

      <title>Permutation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>permutation</term> is an ordered arrangement of objects.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If I want to arrange five books on a shelf, how many possible arrangements of the books are there?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer component="video">
        <video youtube="UF_xPGO71hw"/>
      </answer>
    </example>

    <p>
      Intuitively, the permutation of the five books is just the multiplication principle. There are five choices for the first, four for the second, ... until there's only one choice. We found it was <m>5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 5!</m>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many functions <m>f: \{1,2,3\} \to \{1, 2, 3\}</m> are bijections?
        </p>
      </statement>

    </example>


    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If I only want to arrange three of the five books on my shelf, how many ways are there to do that?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer component="video">
        <video youtube="fTxhoMDB5A8"/>
      </answer>
    </example>

    <p>
      This is still just the multiplication principle. There are five choices for the first, four for the second, but this time three choices for the third is our last book we take. Here we found it was <m>5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3</m>. But this suggests a pattern that is established in the following theorem and its useful corollary.
    </p>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>n</m> is a positive integer and <m>r</m> is an integer such that <m>1 \le r \le n</m>, then there are <m>P(n,r) = n\cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \dots \cdot (n-(r-1))</m> <m>r</m>-permutations of a set of <m>n</m> elements.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>


    <corollary>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>n</m> and <m>r</m> are integers with <m>0\le r \le n</m>, then:
          <me>P(n,r) = \dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!}</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>


    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many six-letter vanity license plates are there that have no repeated letters?

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many functions <m>f: \{1,2,3,4\} \to \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m> are injective? [Recall a function is injective <m>\forall a, \forall b ( f(a) = f(b)) \to ( a = b )</m>]
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer component="video">
        <video youtube="7-6KTaUl2G8"/>
      </answer>
    </example>

    <p>
      Permutations count those situations in which order matters, such as arranging books on a shelf. If the order of items doesn't matter, we need to account for it as a combination.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>Combination</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>combination</term> is an unordered selection of objects.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If I want only to select three books from my five books on the bookshelf, in how many ways can I do this?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer component="video">
        <video youtube="0DGmoVjw4Ms"/>
      </answer>
    </example>

    <p>
      One way we can think about solving this previous example is that we solved the permutation question, but then we divided out the possible orderings.  We started with <m>P(n,r)</m>, and divide by <m>r!</m>, the number of ways to arrange the <m>r</m> objects. This gives us a very convenient formula:
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        If <m>n \and r</m> are integers such that <m>0 \le r \le n</m>, then the number of <m>r</m>-combinations from a set of <m>n</m> elements is
        <me>\binom{n}{r} = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}</me>
      </p>
      <aside>
        <title>A word on notation</title>
        <p>
          Other texts sometimes write <m>C(n,r)</m> to be consistent with permutation notation, and TI calculators often have an <m>nCr</m> button. These all mean the same thing. We're using the <q>binomial notation</q> because of a connection we'll make in the next section.

          Coming back to our packing for the weekend scenario from the introduction, let's say, like in <xref ref="example-ironic-outfits"/>, that our closet has five ironic t-shirts, three pairs of pants, and three collegiate hats. We want to pack for our weekend trip, picking out three shirts, two pants, and two hats for our suitcase.  How many ways can we do this?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Just like when I pack, I'll take one topic at a time:
          <ul>
            <li> Picking shirts -- there are <m>3</m> shirts I'm picking from 5, so <m>\binom{5}{3}</m> Although the shirts are all different, the order I put them into the suitcase doesn't matter, so it's a combination.</li>
            <li> Picking my pants -- there are <m>2</m> shirts I'm picking from 3, so <m>\binom{3}{2}</m>.</li>
            <li> Picking my hat -- there are <m>2</m> hats I'm picking from 3, so <m>\binom{3}{2}</m> also.</li>
          </ul>
          In total, then, since the shirts, pants, and hats are all independent of one another, we multiply the results to find there are: there are
          <me>\binom53 \binom32 \binom32 = 90</me>
          So there are ninety different ways to pack for the weekend.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            ... no wonder packing can seem stressful!

          A pizza parlor offers 10 toppings.

      <statement>

          A combination lock consists of a dial with 40 numbers on it. To open the lock, you turn the dial to the right until you reach a first number, then to the left until you get to second number, then to the right again to the third number. The numbers must be distinct. How many different combinations are possible?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Despite its name, we are not looking for a combination here. The order in which the three numbers appears matters. There are <m>P(40,3) = 40\cdot 39 \cdot 38</m> different possibilities for the <q>combination</q>. This is assuming you cannot repeat any of the numbers (if you could, the answer would be <m>40^3</m>).
