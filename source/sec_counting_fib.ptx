        Let's imagine that you have a rectangular grid of blank spaces. How many ways can you tile that grid using either square tiles or two-square-wide dominoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will define an <term><m>n</m>-board</term> to be a rectangular grid of <m>n</m> spaces.

        For example, here are all of the possible tilings for a 4-board:

    <statement>
      <p>
        In how many ways can you tile a 5-board?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We know that a 5-board is just a 4-board with an extra space. How many ways are there to tile this? There are 5 ways to tile a 4-board and all we're doing is adding an extra square. There's <m>5\cdot1 = 1</m> ways to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... but a 5-board is also a 3-board with an extra two spaces at the end. How many ways can we tile this? Well, there are 3 ways to tile the three board, and we just add a domino.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two subdivisions are mutually exclusive (if we added a square to the 3-board, that's turned it into the 4-board, which was already counted above). So we can conclude the number of ways to tile a 5-board is 5+3 = 8.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f_n</m> denote the number of tilings for an <m>n</m>-board.  Then <m>f_0=1</m> (there is one way to tile a 0 board), and <m>f_1=1</m>, and for <m>n \ge 2</m>
        <me>
          f_{n+1} = f_{n} + f_{n-1}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        In an <m>n+1</m>-board, there are <m>f_n</m> ways to tile the first <m>n</m> tiles followed by one square, and there are <m>f_{n-1}</m> to tile the first <m>n-1</m> tiles, followed by a domino. These tilings are disjoint events, and thus <m>f_{n+1} = f_{n} + f_{n-1}</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>


  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>F_n</m> by the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number. Then <m>f_n = F_{n+1}</m> (where we'll make the notational convention that <m>f_{-1}=0</m> so our indices can match).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>


  <p>
    Let's put this to use to verify some Fibonacci identities using combinatorial proof. When we write <term>condition on <m>m</m></term> we mean to consider <q>breaking</q> the board at tile <m>m</m> and count the separate pieces.

    We say that a tiling of an <m>n</m>-board is <term>breakable at cell <m>k</m></term>, if the tiling can be decomposed into two tilings, one covering cells 1 through <m>k</m>, the other <m>k+1</m> through <m>n</m>. It is said to be <term>unbreakable at <m>k</m></term> otherwise.

        For <m>m, n \ge 0,\, f_{m+n} = f_m f_n + f_{m-1}f_{n-1}</m>.

        For <m>n \ge 0</m>:
        <me>\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n-i}{i} = f_n</me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that we'll define <m>\binom{n}{k} = 0</m> if <m>n \lt k</m>. This is reasonable since, for example, if you want to choose 3 objects from a set of 1 object, there are no ways to do it: i.e. <m>\binom{1}{3} = 0</m>.

      <p>
        Question: <q>How many tilings of an <m>n</m>-board exist?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer 1: There are <m>f_n</m> tilings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer 2: Condition on the number of dominoes. If there are no dominoes, then from <m>n</m> cells, we have 0 choices for where to put the domino: <m>\binom{n}{0}</m>. For 1 domino, we will be using a total of <m>n-2</m> squares and domino which will span the remaining two locations. That means that we are using a total of <m>n-1</m> tiles, and so we have <m>\binom{n-1}{1}</m> possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the case where we are using <m>i</m> dominoes, with <m>0\le i \le n/2</m>, we will be using  <m>n-2i</m> squares, or a total of <m>n-2i + i = n-i</m> tiles. To choose where to place the <m>i</m> dominoes, we'll have <m>\binom{n-i}{i}</m> ways to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, there are a total of <m>n \ge 0, \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n-n}{n}</m> tilings of an <m>n</m> board.
      </p>
    </solution>
