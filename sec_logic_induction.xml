        To prove that a statement <m>P(n)</m> is true for all integers <m>n\ge 0</m>, we use the <term>principal of math induction</term>. The process has two core steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Basis step: Prove that <m>P(0)</m> is true.</li>
          <li>Inductive step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some value of <m>k \ge 0</m> and show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <note>
    <p>
      You can think of math induction like an infinite ladder. First, you put your foot on the bottom rung. If you're able to go from the <m>k</m>-th rung to the <m>k+1</m>-st rung, you'll be able to climb forever.

      <p>
        What is wrong with the following <q>proof</q> that all horses are the same color?
      </p>
      <p>
        Proof by induction:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> Base step: the statement <m>P(1)</m> is the statement <q>one horse is the same color as itself</q>. This is clearly true.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Induction step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some integer <m>k</m>. That is, any group of <m>k</m> horses are all the same color.</p>
            <p> Consider a group of <m>k+1</m> horses. Let's line them up. If we look at first <m>k</m> horses, our induction hypothesis tells us they are the same color. Similarly, if we look at the last <m>k</m> horses, they are also the same color. This shows that all <m>k+1</m> horses are the same color.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Thus, by math induction, all horses are the same color.

        The principal of <term>strong math induction</term> is like the so-called weak induction, except instead of proving <m>P(k) \to P(k+1)</m>, we assume that <m>P(m)</m> is true for all values of <m>m</m> such that <m>0 \le m \le k</m>, and we show that the next statement, <m>P(k+1)</m>, is true.

    <title>The difference between 'weak' and 'strong' induction</title>
    <p>
      'Regular'/'weak' induction follows the pattern:
      <ol>
        <li>Basis step.</li>
        <li>Inductive hypothesis is <m>P(k)</m> is true</li>
        <li>We show that <m>P(k)</m> implies that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true</li>
      </ol>
      That is, we use this induction process for claims where it's convenient to show that the pattern follows sequentially in a convenient way. Straight-forward examples are the addition formulas;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Strong' induction follows the pattern:
      <ol>
        <li>Basis step(s).   [may need more than one basis, just like some recurrence relations]</li>
        Inductive hypothesis is that <em>all</em> of <m>P(1), P(2), P(3), \dots P(k)</m> are true.   [this is the 'strong' part; it's a larger assumption]
        <li>We show that the hypothesis implies the next element in the sequence, <m>P(k+1)</m>, is true  [like before]</li>
      </ol>
      the difference between this and the previous induction process is that it's sometimes <em>not convenient</em> to prove that <m>P(k)</m> directly connects to <m>P(k+1)</m>.  Instead, we still need to show that the <em>next</em> element in the sequence <m>P(k+1)</m> is true by appealing to a previous element in the seqence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relevant examples are those like the binary representation of a number - that <m>k</m> has a binary representation doesn't immediately tell us <m>k+1</m> does, but if we can cut the number in half and use the binary representation of that number to scale-up in order to build a binary representation of <m>k+1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Same thing</b> We separate 'weak' and 'strong' induction, but they're really all the same thing. It's just that when it's convenient to show <m>P(k) \to P(k+1)</m>, we write fewer words for our inductive hypothesis. Because if we don't need to use the fact that <m>P(m)</m> is true for all <m>1 \le m \le k</m>, then we just omit that. Mathematicians are lazy.

        <p>
          Use induction to prove for all <m>n \in \N</m> that <m>\d 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We must prove that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \cdots +2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>. Thus let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>, which claims that <m>1 = 2^{0+1} -1</m>. Since <m>2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1</m>, we see that <m>P(0)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>. That is, <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1</m>. We must show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true (i.e., that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} - 1</m>). To do this, we start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
            <md>

              <mrow> 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1} = \amp ~ 2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^{k+1} \amp \text{by inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> = \amp ~2\cdot 2^{k+1} - 1 \amp</mrow>
              <mrow> = \amp ~ 2^{k+2} - 1 \amp</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true so by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

          Prove that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m> for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1+3 +5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>. First the base case, <m>P(1)</m>. We have <m>1 = 1^2</m> which is true, so <m>P(1)</m> is established. Now the inductive case. Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some fixed arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>. That is, <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2</m>. We will now prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true (i.e., that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k+1) = (k+1)^2</m>). We start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
            <md>
              <mrow> 1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) + (2k+1) ~ \amp = k^2 + (2k+1) \amp \text{by ind. hyp.}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = (k+1)^2 \amp \text{by factoring}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> holds, so by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

          Prove that <m>2^n \lt  n!</m> for all <m>n \ge 4</m>. (Recall, <m>n! = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots\cdot n</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>2^n \lt  n!</m>. We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 4</m>. First, we check the base case and see that yes, <m>2^4 \lt  4!</m> (as <m>16 \lt  24</m>) so <m>P(4)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \ge 4</m>. That is, <m>2^k \lt  k!</m>. Now consider <m>P(k+1)</m>: <m>2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!</m>. To prove this, we start with the left side and work to the right side.

              <mrow> 2^{k+1}~ \amp = 2\cdot 2^k \amp</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \lt 2\cdot k! \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \lt (k+1) \cdot k! \amp \text{ since } k+1 \gt 2</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = (k+1)! \amp</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore <m>2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!</m> so we have established <m>P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 4</m>.

                which is exactly what we needed to show. Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction, the original statement <m> 1^2 +2^2 +3^2+...+n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}</m> is true for all integers <m>n\ge 1</m>.

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>n \lt  100</m>. We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case: when <m>n = 0</m>, <m>P(n)</m> is true, because <m>0 \lt  100</m>. Now for the inductive step, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>k \lt  100</m>. Now if <m>k \lt  100</m>, then <m>k</m> is some number, like 80. Of course <m>80+1 = 81</m> which is still less than 100. So <m>k +1 \lt  100</m> as well. But this is what <m>P(k+1)</m> claims, so we have shown that <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          The problem here is that while <m>P(0)</m> is true, and while <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> for <em>some</em> values of <m>k</m>, there is at least one value of <m>k</m> (namely <m>k = 99</m>) when that implication fails. For a valid proof by induction, <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> must be true for all values of <m>k</m> greater than or equal to the base case.

          What is wrong with the following <q>proof</q> of the <q>fact</q> that for all <m>n \in \N</m>, the number <m>n^2 + n</m> is odd?

          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q><m>n^2 + n</m> is odd.</q> We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. Suppose for induction that <m>P(k)</m> is true, that is, that <m>k^2 + k</m> is odd. Now consider the statement <m>P(k+1)</m>. Now <m>(k+1)^2 + (k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1 = k^2 + k + 2k + 2</m>. By the inductive hypothesis, <m>k^2 + k</m> is odd, and of course <m>2k + 2</m> is even. An odd plus an even is always odd, so therefore <m>(k+1)^2 + (k+1)</m> is odd. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

              Inductive step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some integer <m>k \ge 0</m>, that is, <m>k^2 + k</m> is even, and let's consider the following:
              <md>

                <mrow> \amp = k^2 + k + 2k + 2 </mrow>
              </md>
              now <m>k^2 + k = 2l</m> for some integer <m>l</m> by inductive hypothesis, so we have:
              <md>
                <mrow> (k+1)^2 + (k+1) \amp =  k^2 + k + 2k + 2 </mrow>

          Use induction to prove that if <m>n</m> people all shake hands with each other, that the total number of handshakes is <m>\frac{n(n-1)}{2}</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>when <m>n</m> people shake hands with each other, there are a total of <m>\frac{n(n-1)}{2}</m> handshakes.</q>
          </p>

          <p>
            Base case: When <m>n=2</m>, there will be one handshake, and <m>\frac{2(2-1)}{2} = 1</m>.  Thus <m>P(2)</m> is true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inductive case: Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for arbitrary <m>k\ge 2</m> (that the number of handshakes among <m>k</m> people is <m>\frac{k(k-1)}{2}</m>.  What happens if a <m>k+1</m>st person shows up?  How many <em>new</em> handshakes take place?  The new person must shake hands with everyone there, which is <m>k</m> new  handshakes.  So the total is now <m>\frac{k(k-1)}{2} + k = \frac{(k+1)k}{2}</m>, as needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.

          Use the product rule for logarithms (<m>\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)</m>) to prove, by induction on <m>n</m>, that <m>\log(a^n) = n \log(a)</m>, for all natural numbers <m>n \ge 2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The idea here is that if we take the logarithm of <m>a^n</m>, we can increase <m>n</m> by 1 if we multiply by another <m>a</m> (inside the logarithm). This results in adding 1 more <m>\log(a)</m> to the total.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>\log(a^n) = n \log(a)</m>. The base case, <m>P(2)</m> is true, because <m>\log(a^2) = \log(a\cdot a) = \log(a) + \log(a) = 2\log(a)</m>, by the product rule for logarithms. Now assume, for induction, that <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>\log(a^k) = k\log(a)</m>. Consider <m>\log(a^{k+1})</m>. We have
            <me>
              \log(a^{k+1}) = \log(a^k\cdot a) = \log(a^k) + \log(a) = k\log(a) + \log(a)
            </me>
            with the last equality due to the inductive hypothesis. But this simplifies to <m>(k+1) \log(a)</m>, establishing <m>P(k+1)</m>. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1</m>. We will show that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>. First the base case is easy because <m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m> so <m>F_0 = F_1 - 1</m>. Now consider the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true, that is, assume <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k} = F_{2k+1} - 1</m>. To establish <m>P(k+1)</m> we work from left to right:

              Basis step: For <m>n=0</m>, we have that <m>0 = F_0</m> is a Fibonacci number.

            <p>
              Inductive step: Assume that there is an integer <m>k \ge 0</m> such that <m>P(m)</m> is true for all <m>0\le m \le k</m>. That is, <m>m</m> is either a Fibonacci number or the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers. Now let's consider the next number, <m>k+1</m>:

            <p>
              Case 1: If <m>k+1</m> is a Fibonacci number, then we're done.

            <p>
              Case 2: If <m>k+1</m> is not a Fibonacci number, then let <m>F_m</m> be the largest Fibonacci number less than <m>k+1</m>. Since <m>k+1 - F_m \le k</m> then we have that <m>k+1 - F_m</m> is the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers, by inductive hypothesis.

            <p>
              Adding <m>F_m</m> to this sum gives us <m>k+1 - F_m + F_m = k+1</m> which then itself a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.

              <mrow> \amp = 7(7^k - 1) + 6 \amp \text{factor out a 7 from the first two terms}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 7(6j) + 6 \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 6(7j + 1) \amp \text{factor out a 6}</mrow>

          <p>
            Therefore 6 divides <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m>, or in other words, <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
