          The WSU Catalog says of this course: 
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              MATH 321.  Discrete Structures I
            </p>
            <p>
              Cross-listed as CS 321. Provides a mathematical foundation essential to the entire computer science curriculum. Includes propositional and predicate logic, induction, recursion and counting techniques. Prerequisite: MATH 242 or equivalent with a grade point of 2.000 or better.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll be exploring these areas, along with enough number theory to do an interesting application to encryption. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This course is very different that your past math courses. Keep an open mind, and please ask questions! This might be the <q>hardest</q> math class you take, but it can also be one of the most rewarding.

          This book borrows heavily from the exercises of Oscar Levin's <url href="https://github.com/oscarlevin/discrete-book" visual="">Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction</url>.

          The material in section <xref ref="section-counting-fib"/> was first discovered in Arthur Benjamin and Jennifer Quinn's <pubtitle>Proofs that Really Count: The Art of Combinatorial Proof</pubtitle>, and the exercises in that section come from that book, and influenced every choice of Fibonacci sequence problem in the remainder of the text.

          Special thanks goes to the Wichita State Open/Alternative Textbook Initiative for their generous grant to help expand the text.

          I'm also grateful for you, reader, as we go on this journey of mathematics together. This is going to be fun.
