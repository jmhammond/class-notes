      <li> A <term>theorem</term> is a statement can be shown to be true. We generally research the word theorem for an important statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <term>proposition</term> is a <q>less important</q> theorem.
      </li>
      <li> The tools we use to prove a theorem are <term>axioms</term> (or <term>postulates</term>) which are basic assumptions we make, as well as other theorems we've already proven.
      </li>
      <li>
        A less important theorem that will be helpful in proving others is called a <term>lemma</term>.
      </li>
      <li>
      A <term>corollary</term> is a theorem that follows directly from a theorem just proved.</li>
      <li>
        A <term>conjecture</term> is a statement that we think my be true (our intuition suggests it)

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Here's a proposition: <q>If <m>n</m> is an odd integer, then <m>n^2</m> is odd.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement means for the universe of discourse of all integers:
        <me> \forall n ((n \text{ is odd } ) \to (n^2  \text{ is odd }))</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <note>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The universe of discourse was implied in the general statement above. Mathematical propositions will almost always omit the words <q>for all.</q>

    <title>Direct Proof</title>

    <p>A direct proof is used when proving a proposition of the form <m>p \to q</m>. The goal is to show <m>q</m> is true when we assume <m>p</m> is true. Here's the model:</p>
    <proof>
      <p> Assume <m>p</m> is true. </p>
      <p> ... use logical equivalences (and/or mathematics) ... </p>
      <p> Therefore <m>q</m> is true.</p>
    </proof>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is even.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that if <m>m+n</m> and <m>n + p</m> are even integers, then <m>m+p</m> is even.

    <title>Indirect Proofs</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>We still want to show a statement is true, but perhaps that's difficult to approach directly. There are several different indirect proofs. The most frequent indirect approaches are proofs by contraposition and proofs by contradication.</p>
    </introduction>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Proof by Contraposition</title>
      <p>. A proof by contraposition is a direct proof of <m>\neg q \to \neg p</m>. Here's the model:</p>
      <proof>
        <p> Assume <m>\neg q</m> is true. </p>
        <p> ... use logical equivalences (and/or mathematics) ... </p>
        <p> Show <m>\neg p</m> is true. Therefore, <m>p \to q</m> is true by contraposition. </p>
      </proof>
      <p>
        Remember that <m>\neg q \to \neg p \equiv p \to q</m>, so this is a valid argument.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Show that if <m>n</m> is an integer and <m>n^3 + 5</m> is odd, then <m>n</m> is even.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <example xml:id="example-n2even">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that if <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is even.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Proof by Contradiction</title>
      <p>
        A proof by contradiction allows us to prove a statement <m>p</m> which is not necessarily conditional. We accomplish this by assuming <m>\neg p</m> is true, and finding a contradiction. This works because <me> \neg p \to (q \wedge \neg q) \equiv p</me> as we showed in <xref ref="example-contradiction-logic">example</xref>. Here's the model:
      </p>`

      <proof>
        <p> Assume, to the contrary, that <m>p</m> is false, that is <m>\neg p</m> is true.</p> 
        <p> ... use logical equivalences (and/or mathematics) ... </p>
        <p> Arrive at a logical contradiction. Some impossibility. Therefore, <m>p \to q</m> is true by contradiction.</p>
      </proof>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <!-- <example> -->
      <!--   <title>Proof of the infinitude of primes</title> -->
      <!--   <statement> -->
      <!--     Prove that there are infinitely prime numbers. -->
      <!--   </statement> -->
      <!--   <proof> -->

      Proofs of equivalence
    </title>

    <p>
      For statements which are <q>if an only if:</q> <m>p \iff q</m> we need to prove both <m>p \to q</m> and its converse <m>q \to p</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>n</m> is even if and only if <m>n^2</m> is even.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>We actually did this in the two previous subsections. The <xref ref="example-neven">forward direction</xref> and <xref ref="example-n2even">the converse</xref>.</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>n</m> is even if and only if <m>7n+4</m> is even.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove the following are equivalent:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><m>a\lt b</m></li>
          <li>The average of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is greater than <m>a</m> </li>
          <li>The average of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is less than <m>b</m> </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <title>
      Proof by cases
    </title>

    <p>
      Split an argument into completely separate pieces. In the example below we have two cases. Either <m>x \ge y</m> or <m>x \lt y</m>:
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Show that if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are real numbers, then:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              max(<m>x,y</m>) = <m>\dfrac{x+y + |x-y|}{2}</m>
            </li>
            <li>
              min(<m>x,y</m>) = <m>\dfrac{x+y - |x-y|}{2}</m>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <note>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We need to prove each claim separately for each case!
          </p>
        </statement>
      </note>
    </p>
    <p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that <m>5x + 5y</m> is an odd integer when <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are integers of opposite parity (not both even, not both odd).
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

    <title>
      Existence Proofs
    </title>

    <p>
      The claim of an existence theorem is that there is some object that has a property. A <term>constructive proof</term> is one which, during the argumentation, tells the reader specifically how to come up with the object in question. A <term>nonconstructive proof</term> merely confirms the existence of an object, but doesn't give any detail as to how to find it.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that either <m>2 \cdot 10^{500} + 15</m> or <m>2 \cdot 10^{500} + 16</m> is not a perfect square.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that between any two rational numbers is another rational number.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <title>
      Uniqueness proofs
    </title>

    <p>
      The claim of a uniqueness theorem is that there exists an element that has a desired property, and that no other element has this property.
      The outline of our proof is often:
      <ul>
        <li>Prove the existence of <m>x</m>, some element that has the property we want.</li>
        <li>Assume that a second element, <m>y</m> also has that property.</li>
        <li>Conclude that <m>x = y</m> </li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that if <m>a, b, c</m> are real numbers, then thare is a unique solution to the algebraic equation <m>ax+b=c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that if <m>n</m> is an odd integer, then there exists a unique integer <m>k</m> such that <m>n = (k-2) + (k+3)</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <title>Vacuous and Trivial Proofs</title>
    <definition>
      <p>A <term>vacuous statement</term> is one that is true because the hypothesis is false. You can <q>prove</q> a statement is true immediately.
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If I play in the Super Bowl, I will throw the game winning touchdown.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since I won't ever play in the Super Bowl, it doesn't matter what the truth value of the touchdown statement is. <m>F\to T \equiv T</m> and <m>F \to F \equiv T</m> just the same.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      </p>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      
      <p>
        If we know that the conclusion of a statement is true, then the statement has a <term>trivial</term> proof.

        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>P(x)</m> be the statement <q>If <m>x\in \mathbb{R}</m> and <m>x \gt 0</m> , then <m>x^2 + 1 \ge 0</m></q>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since we know that <m>x^2 \ge 0</m> for any real number, <m>x^2 + 1 \ge x^2 \ge 0</m>. We didn't need the hypothesis <m>x \gt 0</m>. This is a trivial proof.
            </p>
          </solution>

        </example>
      </p>
    </definition>

  <subsection>
    <title>Counterexamples Revisited</title>
    <p>
      Recall in math propositions, the universal quantifier is implied and is usually omitted.  To show a statement is false, we need only find a single counterexample. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Each of the following statements is false. Find a specific counterexample and explain why the statement is false.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If <m>n</m> is a real number, then <m>(n+4)^2 = n^2 + 16</m>.</li>
          <li>Every integer is the sum of the squares of two integers.</li>
          <li><m>\forall x \forall y (x^2 = y^2 \to x = y)</m> where the domain of all variables is the set of all integers. </li>
          <li>The product of two irrational numbers is irrational.</li>
          <li>The sum of two irrational numbers is irrational.</li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </example>

                    Let <m>n</m> be an integer. Assume <m>n</m> is even. Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Thus <m>8n = 16k = 2(8k)</m>. Therefore <m>8n</m> is even.

          Your <q>friend</q> has shown you a <q>proof</q> he wrote to show that <m>1 = 3</m>. Here is the proof:
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            I claim that <m>1 = 3</m>. Of course we can do anything to one side of an equation as long as we also do it to the other side. So subtract 2 from both sides. This gives <m>-1 = 1</m>. Now square both sides, to get <m>1 = 1</m>. And we all agree this is true.
          </p>
        </proof>

        <p>
          What is going on here? Is your friend's argument valid? Is the argument a proof of the claim <m>1=3</m>? Carefully explain using what we know about logic. Hint: What implication follows from the given proof?

          Suppose that you would like to prove the following implication:
        </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime then <m>n</m> is solitary.</p>
          </blockquote>
        <p>
          Write out the beginning and end of the argument if you were to prove the statement,

          Prove that <m>\sqrt 3</m> is irrational.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>\sqrt{3}</m> were rational. Then <m>\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}</m> for some integers <m>a</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m>. Without loss of generality, assume <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is reduced. Now
            <me>
              3 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
            </me>
          <me>
            b^2 3 = a^2
          </me>
        </p>
          <p>
            So <m>a^2</m> is a multiple of 3. This can only happen if <m>a</m> is a multiple of 3, so <m>a = 3k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Then we have
            <me>
              b^2 3 = 9k^2
            </me>
          <me>
            b^2 = 3k^2
          </me>
        </p>
          <p>
            So <m>b^2</m> is a multiple of 3, making <m>b</m> a multiple of 3 as well. But this contradicts our assumption that <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is in lowest terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, <m>\sqrt{3}</m> is irrational.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We will prove the contrapositive: if <m>n</m> is even, then <m>5n</m> is even.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer, and suppose <m>n</m> is even. Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Thus <m>5n = 5\cdot 2k = 10k = 2(5k)</m>. Since <m>5k</m> is an integer, we see that <m>5n</m> must be even. This completes the proof.

          Prove that <m>\log(7)</m> is irrational.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We give a proof by contradiction.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose, contrary to stipulation that <m>\log(7)</m> is rational. Then <m>\log(7) = \frac{a}{b}</m> with <m>a</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m> integers. By properties of logarithms, this implies
            <me>
              7 = 10^{\frac{a}{b}}
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Equivalently,
            <me>
              7^b = 10^a
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            But this is impossible as any power of 7 will be odd while any power of 10 will be even.  Therefore, <m>\log(7)</m> is irrational.
