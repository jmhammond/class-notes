  <subsection>
    <title>Basic number concepts </title>
  <p>
    Before we start, we need to formally define some basic concepts of numbers.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A number <m>n</m> is said to be <term>even</term> if it is a multiple of 2. That is, if there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>n = 2k</m>, then <m>n</m> is even.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li> 6 is even since <m>6 = 2\cdot 3</m> </li>
          <li> 0 is even, since <m> 0 = 2\cdot 0</m></li>
          <li> -8 is even, since <m>-8 = 2 \cdot (-4)</m></li>
          <li> 9 is not even, since there is no integer <m>k</m> such that <m>9=2k</m></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A number <m>n</m> is said to be <term>odd</term> if it is not a multiple of 2. That is, if there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>n = 2k + 1</m>, then <m>n</m> is odd.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li> 7 is odd since <m>7 = 2\cdot 3 + 1</m> </li>
          <li> -1 is odd, since <m> -1 = 2\cdot (-1) + 1</m></li>
          <li> 8 is not odd, since there is no integer <m>k</m> such that <m>8=2k+1</m></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A number <m>n</m> is said to be <term>rational</term> if there exist integers <m>a, b</m> with <m>b \not=0 </m> such that <m>n = \dfrac{a}{b}</m>. If a number is not rational, we say that it is is <term>irrational</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li> 7 is rational since <m>7 =  \frac71</m> </li>
          <li> <m>\frac12</m> is rational, since both 1 and 2 are integers</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

    <title>
      Basic concepts of proof
    </title>
  
  <definition>
    <ul>
      <li> A <term>theorem</term> is a statement can be shown to be true. We generally reserve the word theorem for an important statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <term>proposition</term> is a <q>less important</q> theorem.
      </li>
      <li> The tools we use to prove a theorem are <term>axioms</term> (or <term>postulates</term>) which are basic assumptions we make, as well as other theorems we've already proven.
      </li>
      <li>
        A less important theorem that will be helpful in proving others is called a <term>lemma</term>.
      </li>
      <li>
      A <term>corollary</term> is a theorem that follows directly from a theorem just proved.</li>
      <li>
        A <term>conjecture</term> is a statement that we think my be true (our intuition suggests it)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Here's a proposition: <q>If <m>n</m> is an odd integer, then <m>n^2</m> is odd.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        This statement means for the universe of discourse of all integers:
        <me> \forall n ((n \text{ is odd } ) \to (n^2  \text{ is odd }))</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <note>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The universe of discourse was implied in the general statement above. Mathematical propositions will almost always omit the words <q>for all.</q>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </note>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Direct Proof</title>

    <p>A direct proof is used when proving a proposition of the form <m>p \to q</m>. The goal is to show <m>q</m> is true when we assume <m>p</m> is true. Here's the model:</p>
    <proof>
      <p> Assume <m>p</m> is true. </p>
      <p> ... use logical equivalences (and/or mathematics) ... </p>
      <p> Therefore <m>q</m> is true.</p>
    </proof>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is even.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <!--       integers <m>k \and l</m> such that <m>m = 2k</m> and <m>n = 2l</m>. -->
      <!--       Adding them, we have -->
      <!--       <me>m + n = 2k + 2l = 2(k+l)</me> -->
      <!--       Therefore <m>m +n</m> is an even integer. -->

    <title>Indirect Proofs</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>We still want to show a statement is true, but perhaps that's difficult to approach directly. There are several different indirect proofs. The most frequent indirect approaches are proofs by contraposition and proofs by contradication.</p>
    </introduction>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Proof by Contraposition</title>
      <p>. A proof by contraposition is a direct proof of <m>\neg q \to \neg p</m>. Here's the model:</p>
      <proof>
        <p> Assume <m>\neg q</m> is true. </p>
        <p> ... use logical equivalences (and/or mathematics) ... </p>
        <p> Show <m>\neg p</m> is true. Therefore, <m>p \to q</m> is true by contraposition. </p>
      </proof>
      <p>
        Remember that <m>\neg q \to \neg p \equiv p \to q</m>, so this is a valid argument.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Show that if <m>n</m> is an integer and <m>n^3 + 5</m> is odd, then <m>n</m> is even.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <!-- <solution> -->
        <!--   <proof> -->
        <!--     <statement> -->
        <!--       (By contraposition) Assume that <m>n</m> is an odd integer. Then -->
        <!--       there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>n = 2k+1</m>. Then, -->
        <!--       <md> -->
        <!--         <mrow> n^3 + 5 \amp= (2k+1)^3 + 5 </mrow> -->
        <!--         <mrow> \amp= 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1 + 5 </mrow> -->
        <!--         <mrow> \amp= 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 5 </mrow> -->
        <!--         <mrow> \amp= 2(4k^2 + 3k + 3) </mrow> -->
        <!--       </md> -->
        <!--       thus <m>n^3 + 5</m> is even. Therefore, if <m>n^3 + 5</m> is odd, -->
        <!--       <m>n</m> is even by contraposition. -->
        <!--     </statement> -->
        <!--   </proof> -->
        <!-- </solution> -->

      </example>
      <example xml:id="example-n2even">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that if <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is even.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <!-- <solution> -->
        <!--   <proof> -->
        <!--     <statement> -->
        <!--       (By contraposition): Assume that <m>n</m> is odd. Then there -->
        <!--       exists an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>n= 2k+1</m>. Then -->
        <!--       <me> n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) 1 </me> -->
        <!--       Thus <m>n^2</m> is odd. Therefore, if <m>n^2</m> is even, <m>n</m> -->
        <!--       is even by contraposition. -->
        <!--     </statement> -->
        <!--   </proof> -->

      <title>Proof by Contradiction</title>
      <p>
        A proof by contradiction allows us to prove a statement <m>p</m> which is not necessarily conditional. We accomplish this by assuming <m>\neg p</m> is true, and finding a contradiction. This works because <me> \neg p \to (q \wedge \neg q) \equiv p</me> as we showed in <xref ref="example-contradiction-logic">example</xref>. Here's the model:
      </p>

      <proof xml:id="contradiction-model">
        <p> Assume, to the contrary, that <m>p</m> is false, that is <m>\neg p</m> is true.</p> 
        <p> ... use logical equivalences (and/or mathematics) ... </p>
        <p> Arrive at a logical contradiction. Some impossibility. Therefore, <m>p</m> is true by contradiction.</p>
      </proof>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <!-- <example> -->
      <!--   <title>Proof of the infinitude of primes</title> -->
      <!--   <statement> -->
      <!--     Prove that there are infinitely prime numbers. -->
      <!--   </statement> -->

      Proofs of equivalence
    </title>

    <p>
      For statements which are <q>if an only if:</q> <m>p \iff q</m> we need to prove both <m>p \to q</m> and its converse <m>q \to p</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>n</m> is even if and only if <m>n^2</m> is even.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>We actually did this in the two previous subsections. The <xref ref="example-neven">forward direction</xref> and <xref ref="example-n2even">the converse</xref>.</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>n</m> is even if and only if <m>7n+4</m> is even.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove the following are equivalent:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><m>a\lt b</m></li>
          <li>The average of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is greater than <m>a</m> </li>
          <li>The average of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is less than <m>b</m> </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </example>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>
      Proof by cases
    </title>

    <p>
      Split an argument into completely separate pieces. In the example below we have two cases. Either <m>x \ge y</m> or <m>x \lt y</m>:
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Show that if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are real numbers, then:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              max(<m>x,y</m>) = <m>\dfrac{x+y + |x-y|}{2}</m>
            </li>
            <li>
              min(<m>x,y</m>) = <m>\dfrac{x+y - |x-y|}{2}</m>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <note>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We need to prove each claim separately for each case!
          </p>
        </statement>
      </note>
    </p>
    <p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that <m>5x + 5y</m> is an odd integer when <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are integers of opposite parity (not both even, not both odd).
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
    </p>

    <title>
      Existence Proofs
    </title>

    <p>
      The claim of an existence theorem is that there is some object that has a property. A <term>constructive proof</term> is one which, during the argumentation, tells the reader specifically how to come up with the object in question. A <term>nonconstructive proof</term> merely confirms the existence of an object, but doesn't give any detail as to how to find it.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that either <m>2 \cdot 10^{500} + 15</m> or <m>2 \cdot 10^{500} + 16</m> is not a perfect square.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Let me get you started on it, and we can discuss below. Notice that the two numbers are one apart from eachother. They're massive, so we don't necessarily know whether they're square, but we need only show that not more than one of them is square.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's imagine that I have a square number, namely <m>n^2</m>. Is it possible that <m>n^2 - 1</m> or <m>n^2 + 1</m> is also a square number? What condition on <m>n</m> is required?
        </p>
      </hint>

    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that between any two rational numbers is another rational number.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          If we have two rational numbers <m>a/b</m> and <m>c/d</m> with <m>a, b, c, d \in \Z</m> and <m>b, d \ne 0</m>, then we can construct <m>\frac{a+c}{b+d}</m>. Show that this is a rational number which is contained between the two original numbers.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </example>

    <title>
      Uniqueness proofs
    </title>

    <p>
      The claim of a uniqueness theorem is that there exists an element that has a desired property, and that no other element has this property.
      The outline of our proof is often:
      <ul>
        <li>Prove the existence of <m>x</m>, some element that has the property we want.</li>
        <li>Assume that a second element, <m>y</m> also has that property.</li>
        <li>Conclude that <m>x = y</m> </li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that if <m>a, b, c</m> are real numbers with <m>a\ne 0</m>, then there is a unique solution to the algebraic equation <m>ax+b=c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          You know how to solve an algebraic equation. Now assume there's a second solution. Show that the two solutions are equal.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that if <m>n</m> is an odd integer, then there exists a unique integer <m>k</m> such that <m>n = (k-2) + (k+3)</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Similar to above, show that <m> k</m> satifies this equation, and then show that if you have another number, say <m>l</m> that also does, it must be the case that <m>k = l</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </example>

  <subsection>
    <title>Vacuous and Trivial Proofs</title>
    <definition>
      <p>A <term>vacuous statement</term> is one that is true because the hypothesis is false. You can <q>prove</q> a statement is true immediately.
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If I play in the Super Bowl, I will throw the game winning touchdown.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since I won't ever play in the Super Bowl, it doesn't matter what the truth value of the touchdown statement is. <m>F\to T \equiv T</m> and <m>F \to F \equiv T</m> just the same.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      </p>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      
      <p>
        If we know that the conclusion of a statement is true, then the statement has a <term>trivial</term> proof.

        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>P(x)</m> be the statement <q>If <m>x\in \mathbb{R}</m> and <m>x \gt 0</m> , then <m>x^2 + 1 \ge 0</m></q>.
            </p>
          </statement>

    <title>Counterexamples Revisited</title>
    <p>
      Recall in math propositions, the universal quantifier is implied and is usually omitted.  To show a statement is false, we need only find a single counterexample. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Each of the following statements is false. Find a specific counterexample and explain why the statement is false.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If <m>n</m> is a real number, then <m>(n+4)^2 = n^2 + 16</m>.</li>
          <li>Every integer is the sum of the squares of two integers.</li>
          <li><m>\forall x \forall y (x^2 = y^2 \to x = y)</m> where the domain of all variables is the set of all integers. </li>
          <li>The product of two irrational numbers is irrational.</li>
          <li>The sum of two irrational numbers is irrational.</li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            For example, <m>n = 1</m> works, since <m>(1+4)^2 = 25 \ne 17 = 1+16</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The number 7 isn't the sum of two squares. The only squares smaller than 7 are 1 and 4. They don't add to 7. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Choosing <m>x=  -1 \and y = =1</m> we have <m>(-1)^2 = (1)^2</m> but certainly <m>-1 \ne 1</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            We know (from above) that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational. Multiply it by itself. You get <m>2</m> which is rational.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider <m>a = \sqrt{2}</m> and <m>b=-\sqrt{2}</m>. Then their sum, <m>a+b = 0</m>, which is rational.

          Your <q>friend</q> has shown you a <q>proof</q> he wrote to show that <m>1 = 3</m>. Here is the proof:
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            I claim that <m>1 = 3</m>. Of course we can do anything to one side of an equation as long as we also do it to the other side. So subtract 2 from both sides. This gives <m>-1 = 1</m>. Now square both sides, to get <m>1 = 1</m>. And we all agree this is true.
          </p>
        </proof>

        <p>
          What is going on here? Is your friend's argument valid? Is the argument a proof of the claim <m>1=3</m>? Carefully explain using what we know about logic.

          Prove that <m>\sqrt 3</m> is irrational.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>\sqrt{3}</m> were rational. Then <m>\sqrt{3} = \frac{a}{b}</m> for some integers <m>a</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m>. Without loss of generality, assume <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is reduced. Now
            <me>
              3 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
            </me>
          <me>
            3b^2  = a^2
          </me>
        </p>
          <p>
            So <m>a^2</m> is a multiple of 3. This can only happen if <m>a</m> is a multiple of 3, so <m>a = 3k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Then we have
            <me>
              3b^2 = 9k^2
            </me>
          <me>
            b^2 = 3k^2
          </me>
        </p>
          <p>
            So <m>b^2</m> is a multiple of 3, making <m>b</m> a multiple of 3 as well. But this contradicts our assumption that <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is in lowest terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, <m>\sqrt{3}</m> is irrational.

          Prove the statement: For all integers <m>n</m>, if <m>5n</m> is odd, then <m>n</m> is odd. Clearly state the style of proof you are using.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We will prove the contrapositive: if <m>n</m> is even, then <m>5n</m> is even.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer, and suppose <m>n</m> is even. Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Thus <m>5n = 5\cdot 2k = 10k = 2(5k)</m>. Since <m>5k</m> is an integer, we see that <m>5n</m> must be even. This completes the proof.

          Prove that <m>\log(7)</m> is irrational.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We give a proof by contradiction.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose, contrary to stipulation that <m>\log(7)</m> is rational. Then <m>\log(7) = \frac{a}{b}</m> with <m>a</m> and <m>b \ne 0</m> integers. By properties of logarithms, this implies
            <me>
              7 = 10^{\frac{a}{b}}
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            Equivalently,
            <me>
              7^b = 10^a
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            But this is impossible as any power of 7 will be odd while any power of 10 will be even.  Therefore, <m>\log(7)</m> is irrational.

        <p>
          Prove that for all integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, if <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>, then <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is even.

          Try a proof by contradiction.

      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The negation of the statement is <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m> and both
          <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are odd.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Assume that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both odd and that <m>a^2 +b^2 = c^2</m>. Then there exist integers <m>k</m> and <m>l</m> such that <m>a=2k+1</m> and <m>b=2k+1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we observe that
              <md>
                <mrow>a^2 + b^2 \amp= (2k+1)^2 + (2l+1)^2 </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 4l^2 + 4l + 1 </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = 4k^2 + 4k + 4l^2 + 4l + 2 </mrow>
              </md>
              so that <m>c^2</m> and hence <m>c</m> is even.  Let <m>c=2m</m> where <m>m</m> is some integer. Then:
              <md>
                <mrow>c^2 \amp = a^2 + b^2 </mrow>
                <mrow>(2k)^2 \amp = 4k^2 + 4k + 4l^2 + 4l + 2 </mrow>
                <mrow>4k^2 \amp = 4(k^2 + k + l^2 + l) + 2 </mrow>
              </md>
              This is a contradiction as we have a multiple of four being equal to something which is not a multiple of four.  Thus, our original assumption was incorrect and therefore if <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>, we conclude that one of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is even.

                Assume, to the contrary, that there is an integer solution, <m>(a, b)</m>, to the equation <m>x^2 = 4y + 3</m> We'll split this into four cases:

                Then there exist integers <m>k</m> and <m>l</m> such that <m>x=2k+1</m> and <m>y = 2l</m>. Plugging this into the equation, we have:

                This is not possible, as 2 is not a multiple of 4.

                <p> Case 2: <m>x</m> is even and <m>y</m> is odd.
                Then there exist integers <m>k</m> and <m>l</m> such that <m>x=2k</m> and <m>y = 2l+1</m>. Plugging this into the equation, we have:
