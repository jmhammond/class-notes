<p>We know that a 5-board is just a 4-board with an extra space. How many ways are there to tile this? There are 5 ways to tile a 4-board and all we're doing is adding an extra square. There's \(5\cdot1 = 1\) ways to do this.</p>
<p>... but a 5-board is also a 3-board with an extra two spaces at the end. How many ways can we tile this? Well, there are 3 ways to tile the three board, and we just add a domino.</p>
<p>These two subdivisions are mutually exclusive (if we added a square to the 3-board, that's turned it into the 4-board, which was already counted above). So we can conclude the number of ways to tile a 5-board is 5+3 = 8.</p>
